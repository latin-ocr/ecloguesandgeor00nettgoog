to judge os him not only as a poet, but as a critic os the poetry

With regard to Hesiod, indeed,there is considerable reason to
doubt whether we possess the whole of what Virgil set himself to
copy. Various agricultural precepts are cited from Hesiod—for
instance, about the culture of the olive and the vine—which find
no place in the Works and DayS, as we now read them; and
though some os these may be disposed of by the consideration
that the name os Hesiod was often loosely applied to any thing
which might fall under the head os rural didacticS, enough remains
os a more strictly Hesiodic character to render some other hypo-
thesis necessary—whether it be the popular German theory that
the extant Works and DayS‚ interpolated as the same authority
pronounces them to be, represent only a part of the work which
was read by Virgil, or the more cautious speculation of Colonel
Mure, who refers the unincorporated fragments to some of the

·lost poems traditionally ascribed to Hesiod, such as the Astro-

nomy and the Maxims os Cheiron. Possibly Propertius ¹ may
have been thinking of these when he addressed Virgil as repeat-
ing in song the directions of the old Ascraean bard, and telling of
the plain in which the corn-crop grows greenest‚ the slope on
which the grape clusters best, though it is equally likely that he
simply intended to acknowledge the Georgics as a Hesiodic poem,
characterizing them, not by any thing in Hesiod, but by their own
argument as summed up in the exordium of the First Book. In
any case, however, we may be sure that what we have lost bears
no proportion in value‚ as a means of estimating the relations of
Hesiod and Virgil, to what we have preserved. The recovery os
the whole of Hesiod’s poetry would doubtless supply us with
illustrations of many passages in the Georgics : it is not needed
to indicate and shadow forth, though it might possibly deepen‚
the contrast between the poet of Augustan Rome and the hals-
mythical minstrel of Boeotia.
