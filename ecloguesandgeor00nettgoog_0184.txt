P. VERGILI MARONIS

Vare‚ tuas cupiant et tristia condere bella—
agrestem tenui meditabor harundine Musam.
non iniussa cano, si quis tamen haec quoque, si quis

captus amore leget, te nostrae, Vare‚ myricae,
te nemus omne canet ; nec Phoebo gratior ulla est,

quam sibi quae Vari praescripsit pagina nomen.
Pergite, Pierides, Chromis et Mnasyllos in antro

Silenum pueri somno videre iacentem,

inflatum hesterno venaS, ut semper, Iaccho: ις

serta procul tanturn capiti delapsa iacebant,

7. ‘Condere bena,’ like ‘condere car·
men.’ Forb. comp. Ov. Trist. 11 336,
‘ Caesaris acta condere.’ ‘Tristia' is a
perpetual epithet ; see on v. 3.

8. Comp! 1 2. ‘ Agrestem—Musam'
is from Lucr. v 1398, ‘agrestis enim tum
Musa vigebat.'

9. ‘ Tamen ' seems to show that ‘ non ’
belongs to ‘ cano,’ as Voss takes it, not to
‘ iniussa,' as Heyne. ⁴ Iniussa' thenis a
litoteS, like ‘inlaudati' G. 111 5. ‘1 do
not sing where Ῑ have no warrant.' [Cor-
nutuS, according to the Verona scholia,
thought that ‘ non iniussa' referred to the
command of the Muses—H. N.]

‘ Si quis ’ is repeated like ‘ si forte ’ A.
11 756, where hope and doubt are similarly
extiffisiegaptusamoress G. 111 285. ‚⁸ Legatf
the reading of two cursives and Priscian, is
preferred by Voss 3 but the confidence ex-

ressed by the future is not unsuited to
..in‘g'flssi {Zassispfffffess} ,3253 ...5433
and 1 feel that 1 shall, you will be known
equally by them, for 1 shall sing of you.’
⁴ Myricae,’ ιν 2, the humbler equivalent
os what is espressed more ambitiously by
⁴ nemus omae! Perhaps ‘nemus’ may
refer to the plantations, comp. v11 59.
Possibly ‘ nostrae ' (comp. ⁴ tua,' 1 46)
may be meant to acknowledge Varus’ pro·
tecnon, given or expected, of the poet’s
przeergyffe‘se—eggcnpgngogbpm to give the
ground of his confidence. A poem in
honour os Varus, however homely its
treatment, is sure to be inspired by Apono,
, and·read by the world.

12. ‘Which has the name of Varus as
its title,' showing, as Voss remarkS, that
Varus, not Silenus, is the true title of this
Eclogue.

13-30. ‘ Two young she herds once found
Silenus in a drunken s eep, bound him
with the help of a Naiad, and exacted
from him a song which he had promised
them. He begins, amid general delight.'

13. ‘Pergere’ is used both of cgntinuing
t-o do a thin and of roceeding to do what-
one has not one be ore. Here the latter
is the sense. [‘ “ Pergite,” agite. ’ Vergilius
‘ Per 'te, Pierides.’ F est. p. 215.—H. N.]

It as been doubted whether Chromis
and Mnasyllos are satyrs
shepherds, In sup rt of the former
view, that of Serv„ oss remarks that the
wood-gods did not commonly appear to
she herdS, who were believed to be struck
wit madness by the s‘ ht os them. But
it is easy to retort wit Martyn that the
word ‘timidis,’ v. 20, shows the adven·
turers to have selt their danger, while
their previous acquaintance with Silenus
is quite in keeping with such passages as
x 24 fon„ G. ιι 493. In the story of
Theopompus (see Introd.), the capturers
of Silenus are she herds (as Aristaeus
ca tures Proteus in . lv), though on the
ot er hand there is no previous familiarity
between them and their prisoner. In the
imitation by Nemesianus», Ecl. ιν, Pan
sings to some she herds who have found
him asleep, and lpurniuS, Ecl. vt 48,
makes Mnasyllos the name os a shepherd,
as Voss allows. The word ‘ pueri ’ proves
nothing either way, as it may very well be
a correlative of ‘senex,' and so applied
elsewhere to Cupid and Bacchus. [⁶ Mna·

16. ‘ Tantum ’ answers to ὅσον in such
phrases as ὅσον οὐκ Virg. seems to have
intended ⁴ procul tantum as a translation
oi τυτθὸν ὅσσον ἄπωθεν, Theocr. 1 45,
only thus much of distance. Comp. Il.
