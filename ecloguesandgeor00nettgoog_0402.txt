85. [‘ Premens : ’ Pal„ Rom„ Gud.‚

⁸ Ignem,’ the hot breath. The steam
seems to have s ested the idea of smoke.
Comp. the fable o the horses os DiomedeS,
‘s irantes naribus ignem’ (Lucr. v 29).
‘ &olvere ’ is used of breath Lucr. vl 1227,
⁸ vitalis ae'ris auras Volvere in ore.’

86. ‘ Iactata,’ after being tossed up.
Boringer, quoted by Schneider on Varro
11 7, says that the ancients got up on the
right side of the horse, and used the mane
to mount with. Comp. Prop. v (lv) iv 38,
‘ Cui Tatius dextras collocat ipse iubas.’

87. ‘ Duplex spina' appears to be a
hollow spine, opposed to ‘extans’ Varro
l. c., Col. v1 29.

88. Varro and Col. l. c. mention ‘ durae
ungulae' as a ood point. A hard and
thick hoof wo d be especially requisite
when horses were not shod with iron.
Comp. the Homeric κρατερώνυχες ἵπποι.
Rom. has ‘ quatit ungula,’ from a recollec-
tion ofA. vul 596.

89·94. ‘ Such was the steed that learnt
to obey the rein of Amyclaean Pollux, Cyl·
larus, and those of which Greek song has
ἓξὲξ {12¹ “ee‘ssaiieoi‘iffg’fiyn’igssiyh‘iffififfl⁸2¹5:
such was the great god Saturn himself,
when quick as lightning he flung his mane
over that horse’s neck of his, as he heard
his wife’s ste , and, as he ran, thrilled
throu h the eight and depth of Pelion
with 's clear sharp neigh. These my-
thological allusions are obviously intended
to ennoble the subject3 but they tend to

90. Castor is generally the rider of Cyl-
larus, and Pollux a boxer. SuidaS, how-
ever, ε. v. Κύλλαρος, quotes Stesichorus

than Serv· and Philarg., say ¹ Equos autem
a Neptuno Iunoni datos Alcman lyricus
dicit Cyllarum et Xanthum, quorum Pol-
luci Cyllarum, Xanthum fratri eius con·
cessum esse dictum est. ²—H. N .]

91. ‘Martis equi:' see 11. xv 119.
The notion of Serv, that Δεῖμος and Φόβος
were the names of the horses rests on a
mistranslation ς they are the names of the
attendants. Ι

⁵‘A‘ichilli³ The orthography fluctuates
between ‘Achilli’ or ‘ Achillei ' (so Pal.)
and ‘Achillis.' 1 have followed Wagn„
as a reference to A. 1 30, 11 476, seems to
show that he is right in deciding the quoe-
tion in each case by euphony.

92. ‘Iubam effundit,’ in flight, as is
shown by ‘ pernix ’ and ‘fugiens’ [‘ Es-
fundit’ has overwhelming authority as
against ‘effudit,' which Forb„ however,
still retains. No doubt the perf. which
follows, ‘implevit,' is a difficulty in the
way of reading ‘effundit' But see Co·
nington on Persius xv 2, who quotes Hor.
S. 11 iii 277, ‘ Marius cum praeci itat se,
Cerritus fuit ?' The present resem 1oe that
in Pers. l. c. ‘sorbitio tollit quem dira
cicutae,’ and is apparently intended to
express the fact that the story or history
continues to be well known. Comp. also
A. vul 294 ‘ tu Cresia mactas Prodigia,'
and 1x 265 note—H. Ν.]

93. ‘Coniugis’ Rhea, or Ops, to hide
from whom his amour with the nymph
Philyra Saturn changed himself into a
horse and the nymph into a mare. The
idea is taken from Apoll. R. 11 1234,
where Saturn is described galloping off
oRnh being surprised with the nymph by

ea.
