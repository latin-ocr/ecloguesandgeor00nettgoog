LI FE OF VIRGIL. xix

given in two Beme manuscripts) Epidius, who also numbered An'tonius
and Octavianus among his pupils. The earliest specimen quoted of his
poetry is a couplet said to have been written in his boyhood as an
epitaph on a brigand Ballista, the master of a school of gladiators:

‘ Monte sub hoc lapidum tegitur Ballista sepultus 3
nocte die tutum carpe, viator, iter.’ ¹

Suetonius says that among his other studies Virgil paid attention to
medicine and astrology.² A notice in the Verona scholia informs us
also that he studied philosophy under Siron, a celebrated Epicurean.³
There are some pretty lines in the collection of the minor poems (κατὰ
λεπτόν) attributed to Virgil, in which the boy expresses the delight with
which he is abandoning rhetoric and grammar, and even poetry, for
philosophy:

‘ Ite hinc, inanes, ite, rhetorum ampullae,
inflata rore non Achaico verba ς

et νος, Stiloque Tarquitique Varroque,
scholasticorum natio madens pingui,

ite hinc, inane cymbalon iuventutis.

magni petentes docta dicta Sironis,
vitamque ab omni vindicabimus cura.

ite hinc, Camenae, vos quoque ite iam, sane
dulces Camenae, (nam, fatebimur verum,
dulces suistis); et tamen meas cartas
Revisitote, sed pudenter et raro)

No scholam, as far as Ι arn aware, see any objection to accepting
these lines as genuine. If they are 80, they are an interesting testimony
to the aspiration for philosophica! culture which Virgil expresses again in
the second Georgic‚ and which never left him.

Like Horace, Virgil long felt the influence of the Epicurean system,
to a part of which at least he expresses his adherence in a passage in
the first Georgic (v. 415 foll). And we may well believe that it was
partly due to the teaching of Siron that Virgil conceived that deep
admiration for Lucretius which no careful critic has sailed to detect.
