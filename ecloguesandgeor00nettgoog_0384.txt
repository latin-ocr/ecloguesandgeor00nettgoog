477. Virg. probably had in his mind
not only Lucr. and the Greek didactic
poem, Xeno hanes, Empedocles and
Aratus, but arse the legendary teachers
of early Greece, Orpheus and Musaeus.
His own notion of an ancient bard is that
of a hierophant os nature, as shown in
Iopas A. 1 740, where he partly repeats
the present passage. The conception
belongs not to Augustan Rome, but to

thought. It had, however, been partially
realized by Lucr. ‚ whose example strongly
influenced Virg., and whose subject is
evidently shadowed out by the following
lineS, as the references will show, while
he, his master, and their followerS, are as
evidently pointed at vv. 490-492 (see
notes there and Introd.). Propertius (tv
(111) v 23) sketches a similar em loyment
sor his old age, when he can no onger be
the poet of love; but his field is larger
