terra tremit, fugere serae et mortalia corda

P. VERGILI MARON IS

per gentis humilis stravit pavor; ille flagranti
aut Athon aut Rhodopen aut alta Ceraunia telo
deicit; ingeminant austri et densissimus imber;
nunc nemora ingenti vent0, nunc litora plangunt.

‘Alta Ceraunia,' a half-translation 01
’Δκροειραὺνια, which Hor. od. 1 iii 20

the fact of lightning striking a mountain
as an argument against its super-natural
origin.

It is apparently intended that one 01 1110

telo' may only mean ‘deicit telum in
Athon) [‘De1ecit,' i.e. ‘deicit,’ Med.
and Rom.—H. N.]

‘Ingeminantt’ the rain and wind in-
crease after a thunderclap. ‘ Quo de eon·

The reflective ‘ planguntur' would be
more usual. But the common use 01
‘ plango ’ with an accusative of the rson
lamented may prepare us sor ing it
used without any expressed object. Jahn
makes ‘austri ' and ‘imber ’ the nomina-
tive, which seems less forcible and appro-
priate. ‘ Plangit,' the reading os Rom.
and Serv. (who also mentions ‘ plangunt ’),
would be awkward‚ whether the nomina·
tive were sought in ‘imber’ or in ‘ Iup-
piter.’ ‘ Doubly loud howls the south
wind, doubly thick gathers the cloud os
rain, and under the blast’s mighty stroke
forest and shore by turns wail in agony.'
