216. ‘ Mino: millet. ‘ Annua cura,’ to
distinguish it from lucerne, which lasted
ten years in the ground. Seu„ Ep. 86,
charges Virg. with inaccuracy, sayin
that he had himself seen beans rea
and millet sown on the same day towards
the end os June. The fact is that the
time os sowing varied according to the
climate, and Virg. is again speaking oi a
colder latitude.

217. ‘Candidus . . . astm,’ a peri-
phrasis sor ⁶ vere.' ‘ In spring time, when
the sun with Taurus rides.’ The allusion,
as Ke’ htley points out, is to the milk·

ether ‘auratis cornibus’ is to be
taken descriptively with ‘tauru3,’ or in·
strumentally with ‘aperit‚’ is not clear.
The former is maintained by Serv., who
observes that the bull
back, not with his horus, and seems
more reasonable, as there would be no
natural propriety in the image of a bun

218? The MSS. are [and were in the
time of Serv.] divided between ‘ adverso '
(Med.) and ‘averso ’ (Pal., Rom„ fragm.

as the re erenoe is to the heliacal setting

‘astro’ has been taken os the sun.
‘Averso' would be abl.. perhaps abl.

just mentioned, vv. 215 soll. ‘ astabis

ris,’ A. 1 504. ‘ Press on with an ardour
which only corn can satiss .’

221. ‘ Atlantides? the Pleiades, daugh-
ters of Atlas. Tbese set ‘ ane‚’ in the
morning, about November 11 according
to Pliny 11 125, about October 20 accord·
ing to Col. 11 8, xx 2.

[The apparent morning setting of the
Pleiades at Rome in Virgil's time was
Nov. 8; the apparent evenin setting os
the Crown was Nov. 9: see iet. Ant. i
227, 232]

71. Vi ., hke Democritus in Geop. 11
14 and ¹'ffitolemffi places the setting os
the Crown between November 15 and
December ¹9· Others (Col. xl 2, etc.)
placed its rising about the same time,
though earlier (about October 8); Serv.
accordingly would understand ‘decedat'
os retiring from the Sun. Its sense how·
ever is fixed by such passages as v. 450.
Ε. 11 67. Virg.'s meaning is exproeS,
and his error is sufficiently accounted sor
when its source is pointed out.

‘Stella,’ perhaps because one star in
the Crown is brighter, and rises earlier
than the rest ι but the distinction between

lStlelg‘i, and ‘sidus ' was sometimes over-
oo .
