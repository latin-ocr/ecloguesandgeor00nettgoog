the seed which they have begun to want,
or force the care of a whole year’s hopes
on a reluctant soil.'

224. ‘ Invitae,' like ‘propere5,' refers
in thou ht, though not grammatically, to
the eart bcfimr the proper sowing-time.

For ‘avenis’ (Pa1., Gud.) ‘aristis’ is
found in Med„ Rom„ fragm. Aug„ and
Nonius, pp. 301, 416. ‘ Avenis’ is sup-
}orted by the belief already alluded to on

. v 37, that corn had a tendency to
degenerate into wild oats if it lay too
long in the ground; ‘aristis’ may have
been introduced from v. 220. Col. (x1 2)
mentions an old saying among sarmerS,
‘ Matutam sationem saepe decipere solere ε
seram nunquam uin mala sit.

Arctophylax, sets acronychally from
October 29 to November 2. Kidney-
beans (‘ phaseli ’) were sown a month
earlier when they were intended for eating,
not for seed. Col. xr 2, 5 72. Vetchoe
appear to have been sown twice, in
January and in the autumnal equinox (Col.
11 10). Med. and fragm. Aug. have

succession of the various seasons that the
sun makes his yearly way along the zodiac.
There are five zones; one torrid‚ two
frigid, one at each extreme, and two
temperate between them and the torrid‚
Between the temperate zones passes the
zodiac. There are two poles, one rising

into the depths. In the former are placed
the Serpent and the Bears3 the latter
is either in perpetual darknesS, or visited
by the sun while he is away from us)

various seasons depend in fact on the sun's
