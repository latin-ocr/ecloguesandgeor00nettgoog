P. VERGILI MARONIS

The scenery, as in other Eclogues, is confused and conventional, the beeches (v. 1),
caverns (v. 75), mountains (v. 83), and rocks (vv. 15, 47, 56, 76) belonging to Sicily,
while the marshy river (v. 48) is from Mantua. See Introduction to the Eclogues.
In other respects the poem appears to be original, only the names TityruS‚ Galatea,
and Amaryllis, being borrowed from Theocritus.

M. TITYRE, tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi
silvestrem tenui Musam meditaris avena ;
nos patriae fines et dulcia linquimus arva:
nos patriam fugimus; tut Tityre, lentus in umbra
formonsam resonare doces Amaryllida silvaS. 5
T. O Meliboee, deus nobis haec otia fecit.

1-5. ‘ How is it that while I ani wan·
‹lering an outcast from my native fields,
you are lying in the shade and singing
like a happy shepherd of your mistress? ’

1. Of the three principal MSS„ the
Medicean, Palatine, and Roman, the first
is defective till E. V1 48.

Tityrus (Τᾰτυρος) is one os the T heo-
critean shepherds (Theocr. 111 ii soll.).
'Ibe word is said to be the Doric form of
Σάτυρος, being applied in the same way
to designate a short-tailed ape. Another
account, that it means a reed, was also
received among the ancient critics (Schol.
on Theocr. l. c.,), and is supported by the
words τιτύρινος (αὐλός), τιτυριστήςς but
these may be explained by supposing that
the name had come to have a conventional
sense as a rustic minstrel. [Servius says,
‘ Laconum lingua tityrus dicitur aries
QaJior qui gregem anteire consucvit.'—-H.
l ο

2. ‘Silvestrem,’ pastorah as ‘ silvae²
is used sor pastoral try, tv 3. Forbiger
observes that the ffielians pasture their
cattle in summer among the woody slopes
of the mountains. ‘Silvestrem Musam ’
is from Lucr. tv 589, ‘ Fistula silvestrem
ne cesset fundere Musam.’

[‘ Tenui,’= ‘ humili ' (Serv.) ‘ subtili '
(Schol. Bern.).——H. Ν.] Comp. ‘Agres-
tem tenui meditabor harundine Musam,'
. vt 8, where it is evident from the context
that ‘ tenui’ is meant to be in keeping
with ‘agrestem,’ and to suggest sim-
plicity and humility, at the same time
that it is a natural e ithet os the reed,
like ‘fragili cicuta,' v 5.

‘Musam ι ’ the Muse had come to be
used for the song personified as early as
Sophocles and Euripides, and the usage
is equent in Theocr.

‘ Meditaris,' compose. Hor. S. 1 ix 2,
‘ Nescio quid meditans nugarum et totus
in iuis?

‘ Avena‚’ not a straw (which would be
absurd), but a reed, or a pipe os reedS,
hollow like a straw. So ‘stipula,’ of a
reed, 111 27, though the word there is
designedly contemptuous. Milton, how-
ever, in his Lycidas talks seriously of ‘ the
oaten flute‚’ as he talks contemptuously
os ‘ pipes of wretched straw.’

3. ‘ Patrios fines,' v. 67.

4. He repeats the contrast in an in·
verse order, so that we shall perha do
best to put with Jahn a semicolon er v.
2, a colon after v. 3. Gebauer‚ p. 55, well
remarks that this repetition is after the
manner of Theocritus, com ming Theocr.
lx 1-6, where the editors ve been too
ready to suspect interpolation. Comp.
also Theocr. viu 28-32.

Her. xlx 81, ‘ Certe ego tum ventos audi-
rem lenta sonantis.'

5. ‘ Resonent mihi Cynthia silvae,’
Prop. 1 xviii 31, probably m imitation.

[‘Formonsam, Asper, p. 115. Keil:
⁶ formosam,' Pal. Rom. Gud. 3 for Med.
see vu 38.-H. N. See Wfflfflin's Archiv
v 196. The ‘n’ is not phonetic, but
belon to the original suffix: Bmgmann’s
Grun ‘ ip. 202, ς 238.]

6-10. ‘These rural liberties 1 owe to
one whom 1 shall ever own as a god.'

6. Meliboeus is explained by ServiuS,
ὅτι μέλει αὐτῷ τῶν βοῦνι analogy would
rather point to μέλι as the first part of the
compound. Perhaps the name was· sug·

βοῦς. Comp. Alphesiboeus.

‘ Lentus ’ = ‘ securus.'
