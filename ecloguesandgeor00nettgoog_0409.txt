157-178. ‘After calving‚ think mainly
of the calves, Separate them according
to the destination of each, and treat them
with a view to it. Those which are not
meant for labour may be left to graze ς
those which are, should be trained early,

intended to distin uish the breed ς but we
may doubt with eightley whether such
was really the practice. Perhaps Virg.
confounds the breed with the property of
the breeder‚ meaning no more than that
the cattle are branded that it may be

‘ uos ' being the object of ‘servare‚ the

is applied to a hog’s back, A. 1 634.

162. Martyn appears right in referring
this line, [the genuineness of which Rib-
beck, Proleg. p. 51, suspects,] to what
follows· Such cattle as were intended
for breeding or for killing would be left to
graze, as their only object would be to get
fat: but those which were required for
labour would have to be taken in hand.
Heyne objects that the next line, in that
case, would be more naturally introduced
by an adversative particle: see however

A. lx 224-226. Perhaps it may be said .

Wagn. remarks. Perhaps there may be
