LIB. ΙΙΙ. 315

densior hinc suboleS‚ hinc largi copia lactis;
quam magis 'exhausto spumaverit ubere mulctra,

laeta magis pressis manabunt flumina mammis,

310

nec minus interea barbas incanaque menta
Cinyphii tondent hirci saetasque comantis
usum in castrorum et miseris velamina nautiS.
pascuntur vero silvas et summa Lycaei,

horrentisque rubos et amantis* ardua dumos;

315

atque ipsae memores redeunt in tecta, suosque
ducunt, et gravido superant vix ubere limen.
ergo omni studio glaciem ventosque nivaliS,
quo minor est illis curae mortalis egestas

averteS, victumque feres et virgea laetus

320

pabula, nec tota claudes faenilia bruma.

308. The recommendations of the goat
enumerated in this and the following lines
are summed up Geopon. xvtn 9, διδυμο-
τοεεῖ δὲ ὡς ἐπὶ πολύ, καὶ τρέφει τὰ γεννώ-
μενα, καὶ προσόδους δίδωσιν οὐκ ὀλίγας, τὰς
ἀπὸ γάλακτος καὶ τυροῦ καὶ κρέως, πρὸς
δὲ τούτοις τὰς ἀπὸ τῆς τριχός. Goats
occasionally bear three, Col. V116. ‘ Copia
lactis,’ E. 1 82. [For the second ‘hinc'
fragm. Vat. has ‘ hic.'—H. N.]

309. Rom. has ‘quo z ' ‘quam’ is the
reading os Ribbeck’s other MSS. and is
sufficiently supported by A. vn 787,
where ‘tam magis . . . quam magis'
occurs. The meaning is, as ⁴ exhausto'
shows ε the fuller the pails aster one milk-
ing, the more will be yielded by the
next.

310. ‘Fluminaz ' Pal„ Rom. [and
Nonius p. 340] give ‘ ubera,' which is
acknowledged by Philarg„ and was pre-
ferred by some earlier editors.

311. ⁸ Incanaque menta,' A. VI 809.

312. ‘Tondent,’ ‘men clip,’ like ‘in-
urunt,’ v. 158. This seems better than to
separate ‘ Cinyphii ' from ‘ hirci,’ making
it nom. plural, or to suppose that the

oats are said to clip their own beards
use they surrender them to the shears.
The latter view, though slightly supported
by ‘barbaS‚’ is discountenaneed by the
use of ‘pascuntur,’ v. 314, of the goats
generally.

The river CinypS, in Libya, is men-
tioned by Hdt. tv 175, 198 ; its goats are
alluded to Martial v111 li 11, x1v 1403

the use to which their hair was put,

by Sil. 111 276. Rom. has ‘ hirciS‚’

which is doubtless due to the initia] letter

os ‘ saetas.’ [⁴ Hirqui ' PaL—H. N .]

..ιῖῗέᾀᾷ ἕαῖἶῗέυἰιζ Ῐῧῖῗὲἓ 3³5²? mi⁰³⁵‘¹³‘
, .

314. ‘ Pascuntur’ is constructed with
an accusative, as being equivalent to a
transitive verb; so ‘depascitur,’ v. 458.

‘ L caei ' (E. x 15), another instance os
speci cation for the sake os dignity.

315. ‘ Amantis litora myrtos,' 1v 124.

[Med. a m. pr., put 316 before 315.]

316. ‘Ipsae lacte domurn reserent dis-
tenta capellae Ubera,' E. lv 21. The
fact, however, is mentioned there as a
wonder, not as part of ordinary nature.
Med. has ‘inmemores.’

‘ SuOS,’ their young.

317. The pause aster the first foot ex-
pressesh th the) slcpwne‘ss qli their approach
wit eir ur en o mi .

318. ‘ Omni studio ’contains the notion
of ‘ eo magi5,' the natural correlative os
‘ quo minor.'

319. ‘Curae mortalis’=‘curae mor·
talium‚’ like ‘ mortalia corda,' 1 1233
⁶ mortalis visu5,’ A. 11 6053 ‘mortali
sermone‚’ Lucr. v 121.

320. ⁸ Virgea pabula,’ the arbutes men-
tioned v. 301.

‘Laetus' seems rightly explained by
Wagn. as ‘larguS,' the epithet belonging
rather to the gift than to the giver.

321. ‘ Let them have good store of hay

the winter through.' -
