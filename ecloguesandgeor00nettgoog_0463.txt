159. ‘ Exercentur agrisz’ ‘exercentur
equis,' A. vn 163 ; the abl. here is prob·
ably local.

‘Saepta domorum ’ [i.e. ‘ saeptas do-
mos! This idiom, unknown to early
Latin and very rare in Cicero, is common
in Lucr. (Munro 1 315, vt 1283). Sallust,
Horace, Livy and later writers, especially
Tacitus. Virg. has it osten in the Aeneid,
but avoids any bold use of it: A. 1 422
‘strata viarum,' 11 332 ‘ angusta viarum,'
11 725 ‘opaea locorum‚’ v 695 ‘ardua
terrarum,' vl 633 ‘opaca viarum‚’ vm
221 ‘ ardua montiS‚’ xl 882 ‘tuta domo-
rum ’ (G. 111 291, A. xr 513 are different).
The idiom, as Madv. 284-5 and others
have observed, is sometimes partitive and
sometimes denotes quality: thus ‘tuta
domorum ’ may = either ‘tutae domorum
μηδ’ 01 ‘tutae domus) It is often
difficult to determine which sense is in·
tgnded: hiere it is plainly the latter. See

. 11 197.

160. See on v. 39. ‘Lacrimam' is
used like δάκρυον in Aristotle (there
quoted) of that which exudes from flowerS,
as in Pliny xl 143 xx1 243 xxm 3, of
the exudations of trees, lilies, and vmeS.
Pliny x1 24 and Theophr. CauS. Pl. 1 4
(referred to by Keightley) assert that lilies
are propagated by these tears. There

cissus. M com Milton's ‘ daffo-
diniae fill their cups with tears,’ where
however the 16212, if not a mere develo ·
ment os the image of the cup, may re 61
10 rain or dew.

162. ‘Suspendunt ε ’ ‘This term is
properly used3 sor bees commence their
work in the top of the hive' (Sheridan).
The latter part of this line, the two which
follow, and vv· 167·169, are repeated with
two or three slight changes, A. 1 431, foll.
[The statistics of such repetitions in Virg.

have been collected by Albrecht, Hermes
xvi (1881), 293.]

163. ‘ Educunt,’ lead out, teach to fly
andffther honey etc. It 6211 hardly be,
as eyne understands it, to lead out

116 quite possible in itself ς 11111 1116 context
seems to point to some single 261 rather
than to a long-continued process.

[‘ Durissima ’ Med. originally for ⁸ puris·
sima.’—H. N.]

164. The honey is called ‘ nectar,’ like
the sweet wine, E. v 71.

165. ‘ Sorti ’ is probably the archaic
form of the ablative, like ‘parti‚’ ‘ruri,’
‘igni‚’ G. 1 234. ‘Cecidit sorti’ is in
fact only 2 poetica] variant on the phrase .
‘ evenit sorti ’ found in Livy (lv xxxvii 6 ς
xxvnt xlv 11, etc.)‚ where ‘sorti ' is abl.
Otherwise, as Heyne says, it might be
dative, ‘as their charge.’ Cerda finds
fault with the word, which os course can·
not strictly be applied to the beeS, alleging
that the Roman sentinels were not ap-
pointed by lot, but succeeded by rotation ς

111 Emm. shows in repl that both prin·
ciples were observed. lx* Virg. has any
distinct meaning, he may probably intend
that the sentry·work falls by lot to the
class, but is taken in turn by the individuals
( ‘- in vicem '). There may however be 2
distinction intended between the ‘ cus·
tedes, ’ who watch against enemies (such as
those mentioned vv. 13 foll.), and the
‘ speculatores,’ who look out for showerS,
perhaps flying abroad sor the purpose.
