Virgil is equally conscious of a difficulty, though the manner
in which he expresses it, while partially borrowed from another
passage in Lucretius, is characteristically different. ‘ For my-
self,' he says (G. 111 289), ‘ 1 too am well assured how hard the
struggle will be for language to plant her standard here, and in-
vest a theme so slender with her own peculiar glory: but there
is a rapturous charm that whirls me along over Parnassus' lonely
steeps ; a joy in surmounting heights where no former wheel has
worn a way, no easy slope leads down to the Castalian spring.’
‘ Angustus hunc addere rebus honorem :' such is the object
which he proposes to himself: and the way in which he attains it
is by keeping out of sight the more prosaic parts of his subject,
substituting poetical ornament, as 1 have said elsewhere, for
logical sequence, and too frequently preferring ambiguity to
tedious repetition. He had to choose between the farmer and
the reader: and in his consideration for the one he has some-
times forgotten the compassion which, at the very outset of his
work, he professes to feel sor the other.

But the question of the reality of the Georgics does not wholly
depend on the value of the work as an agricultural treatise. It
may be true that Virgil is an inaccurate sarmer’s guide, yet true,
also, that he is‘a warm and hearty lover of nature. This is a
praise which is usually conceded to the Georgics without hesita—
tion. Horace said that Virgil received the endowment of deli-
cacy and artistic skill from the Muses of the country; and the
sentence which, in the mouth of its author, was merely the ex-
pression of a fact, has been accepted and repeated in later times
as the announcement of a judgment. Now that Virgil has ceased
to be regarded as the rival of Homer, it is common to represent
him as the poet of rural lise, who is to be estimated not by the
ambitious task which imperial vanity thrust upon his manhood,
but by the more simple and genial works to which he turned of
himself in the freshness of youth. Such is the view which is
enforced by Mr. Keble in his Lectures on Poetry.² That which
