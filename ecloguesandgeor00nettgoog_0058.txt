THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ
VIRGIL.

1. CAECILIUS EPIROTA.

11- was not long before the poems of Virgil began to afford matter for
discussion to lexicographerS, grammarian& and writers on antiquity.
The first scholar who actually lectured upon Virgil was Quintus Caecilius
Epirota, for information about whom we are entirely dependent upon
Suetonius (De GrammaticiS, 16). He waS, it appearS, a freedman of
Pomponius Atticus, the friend of CicerO, and was born at Tusculum.
His cognomen suggests that he may have been the child of Epirot parents,
brought over, perhapS, from the estates of Atticus in EpiruS. The
daughter of Atticus was married to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, and
Caecilius was tutor to this lady. On account of a suspicion which arose
against him with regard to his conduct in this relation, he left the family
of Agrippa and lived henceforth on terms of intimate friendship with the
poet Cornelius Gallus. His character was so unfavourably regarded by
Augustus that this intimacy was the occasion of one of the gravest
charges brought against Gallus by the emperor. After the condemnation
and death of Gallus Caecilius opened a school for a few young men, to
whom he lectured on Virgil and other contemporary poetS. Whether
this was before Virgil's death or not there is no evidence to decide. A
verse written upon him by Domitius Marsus—

‘ Epirota, tenellorum nutricula vatum,’
seems to be pointed at the real or supposed effeminacy of his character.

2. VERRIUS FLACCUS.

Verrius FlaccuS, the compilet of the first Latin lexicon ever written,
must have paid a great deal of attention to Virgil. His work De Ver
borum Significatu has, as is well known, survived only in the abridg-
ments of Festus and Paulus. Even' in these, a considerable number of
quotations from Virgil 1s to be found, and I am inclined to think that
several of the original glosses of Verrius may be partially reconstructed
from later writers, notably from Nonius and Macrobius, who seem to
have preserved them in a fuller form than Paulus or even Festus.
Thus (1) Paulus has preserved the following gloss on daedalus (p. 68,
Miiller), Daedalum a varietate rerum artificiorumque dictum esse apud
Lucretium termm, apud Ennium Minervam, apud Vergilium Circen,
facile est intellegere. Macrobius vl iv 2 remarks that Virgil says
