P. VERGILI MARONIS

curn fugit in Rhodopen atque in deserta Getarum
et lac concretum cum sanguine potat equin0.
quam procul aut molli succedere saepius umbrae

videriS‚ aut summas carpentem ignavius herbaS,

extremamque sequi, aut medio procumbere campo
pascentem, et serae solam decedere nocti,

continuo culpam ferro compesce, prius quam

dira per incautum serpant contagia volgus,

non tam creber agens hiemem ruit aequore turb0, 470
quam multae pecudum pestes nec singula morbi
corpora corripiunt, sed tota aestiva repente,

462. The line is ex ressed as if it re-
ferred exclusively to t e ‘Gelonus,' who
however has really only to do with the
⁸ deserta Getarum, Rhodope belonging to
the Thracian Bisaltae.

‘ Fugit ’ seems merely to express the
migratory habits of the people, wh0, as
Kei htle reminds us, were horsemen.

ed. as ‘ aut ’ for ‘ atque.’

463. ‘ They drink (mares ³) milk coag-
ulated with horses’ blood.’ This custom
is recorded of the Massagetae by Stat.
Ach. 1 307. Horace (Od. 111 iv 34) attri-
butes the raetice of drinking horses'
blood to t e S anish Concani. Pliny
(xvnl 100) sayst t the Sarmatians mixed
millet with the milk or the blood of
mares· The milk of mares is a common
beverage of savage tribes, from Hom.’s
Hippemo i downwards. Virg. is likely
enough to ave mistaken the people, even
if he be right about the custom.

464·477. ‘If you observe a sheep fond
of shade‚ languid in feeding, loitering,
given to lyin down, kill it before it insect
the rest. T e spread os disease is sear-
sully rapid, sweeping off not individuals
but whole flockS. Witness what took
place in the Alpine district of Noricum
and the TimavuS, where the pastures are
still desolate.’

464. ‘ Molli ’ marks the reason why the
shade is sought, and so reflects back, as
Voss remarks, on the seeker.

465. ‘ Summas' marks the listlessness
of the seeder, sheep in health being, as
Mr. Blackburn observes, very close bite-rs,
For ‘ignavius ’ Rom. has ⁴ segnius,³

466. He uses nearly the same words to
express the effect of disease which he had
‘inlployedl’ffi {¹111 ‘87, 88 tgedenote that
o ove. . as coneum re.

467. ‘ Solam ' may mean that it retires
alone, or it may really refer to ‘ nocti,' as
the only thing that has the power to
make it retire. [Comp. Ε. v111 89.—

468. Instead of introducing the ante-
cedent to ‘quam' he changes the sen-
tence. Serv. and some of the old editors
understood ‘culpam ' of the fault of
neglect against which the shepherd was
to guard, remarking ‘habere morbum
culpa non est-² Virg. however evidently
expects his shepherd to feel with Henry
Taylor’s huntsman, ‘ The dog that's lame
is much to blame; It is not fit to live.’
The meaning is that the sheep ia to be
killed, not, as the Delphin editor thinks,
that the disease is to be exterminated by
cutt' .

46¹2.g So ‘ volgus ' of the common herd
os deer, A. 1 190. ‘ Incautum ’ is doubt-
less meant to su est the notion of a
reckless mob, at t e same time that it
expresses the danger of the sheep.

Pal. has ‘serpunt,' but the subj. points
to the intention of the shepherd, who is
to act so as not to give the malady time to
spread.

470. The comparison seems to be
between the quick rush os a sturm-wind
and the rapid spread os each of the va·
rious diseaseS. ‘ Creber,’ then, will be
taken closely with ⁴ agens hiemem,’ like
‘creberque procellis Africus,' A. ι 85.

⁴ Aequore ⁹ may mean either along the
ocean (1 5 note), or from it, like ‘ruit
oceano nox,’ A. 11 250.

⁴ Aequora,' the reading os Rom. and
Gud., approved b Heius. and Heyne, is
rightly condemnet? by Wagn. as disturb-
ing the comparison.
