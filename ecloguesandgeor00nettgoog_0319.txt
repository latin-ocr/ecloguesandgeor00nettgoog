aut arguta lacus circumvolitavit hirund0,
et veterem in limo ranae cecinere querellam.
saepius et tectis penetralibus extulit ova

angustum formica terens iter, et bibit ingens

380

arcu3‚ et e pastu decedens agmine magno
corvorum increpuit densis exercitus alis,

iarn varias pelagi volucreS‚ et quae Asia circum
dulcibus in stagnis rimantur prata Caystri,

certatim largos umeris infundere τοι-ες,

385

nunc caput obiectare freti8‚ nunc currere in undaS,
et studio in cassum videas gestire lavandi.

377. ‘ The swallow is always observed
to fly low before rain, because the flies and
other insects on which she feeds keep at
that time near the surface of the ground
and the water.' Keightley.

‘Arguta‚’ not a perpetual epithet‚ but
denoting that she twitters as she flies.

378. ⁶ Vetus querella ’ has no reference
to legend or sable, as Serv. supposes.
Keightley uotes the schol. on Hor.
Epod. 11 2 , who says that the ancients
used ‘ querella ' of the note of all animals
but man. [Lucr. 11 358, Virg. A. v111
215 use the word of cattle, possibly with
the notion of complaint.]

379. ‘Saepius' denotes repetition (v.
354), which agrees with ‘terens’ Whether
it is to,be extended to ‘bibit' and ‘in-
emeli-neten? ngttefrlglaibusss like ‘adytis pene.
tralibus‚' Xe 11 297, and ‘caeli penetralia
templa,' Lucr. 1 1105. Keightley remarks
that on the contrary the antis observed to

in her eggs at the approach of rain.
[Pliny xvm 64 enumerates among his
prognostics ⁴ ormicae concursantes aut
ova progerentes.’—H. N .]

380. It has been supposed from κοίλης
ὀχῆς, Arat. 224, that ‘terens angustum
iter’ means ‘boring a narrow passage)
But ‘tectis penetralibus ’ is the translation
of κοίλης ὀχῆς, and ‘ angustum iter' is to
be interpreted like ⁸ calle angusto,’ A. lv
405, ‘terens’ (‘terere viam ) being ex-
plained by ‘ saepius.'

381. ⁸ Arcus : ' Aratus has ὃιδύμη Ἰρις.
Plaut. Cure. 1 ii 41, ‘ Ecce autem „bibit
arcus i pluet, Cred0, hercle hodie.’ The
rainbow was supposed to draw up moisture
from the sea, rivers, etc„ with its hornS‚
and to discharge it in rain. Hence
Tibull. 1 iv44and Stat. Theb. 1x 405 talk

of ‘imbrifer arcus.’ Seneca N. Q. 1 6,
who refers to Virg., says that a rainbow
in the south brings heavy rain, in the
west slight showers and dew‚ in the east
fair weather. Virg. of course can only
mean that the a pearance of the rain·
bow is a sign o rain, drawing up the
water being assumed to be its constant
function.

382. ‘Densis alis' looks like a mis-
translation of τιναξάμενοι πτὲρα πυκνὰ in
Arat. 237. It here means however ‘ with
crowded wings!

383. Arat. 210 foll.

⁸ Variae ' Med„ Rom., Gud. originally,
and so Ribbeek3 ‘varias’ Gud. corr.
Serv. mentions both, but emphatically
prefers ‘ varias.' Virg.'s love of variety
might have led him to change the con-
struction (comp. vv. 199 foll., A. 11 775,
notes) 3 but the acc. is neater, and is sup-

ported by the passage from Varro.
‘ Vanae volucres is common m Lucr.

[meaning the different species (Munro 1
589), as here.] ‘Circum‚’ adverbial.
[‘ Atque ’ (adque) for ‘et uae ' Med. and
Rom., and so Probus— . N.]

384. ‘Rimantur Asia prata: ' search,
try in every chink; ‘ rimaturque epulis,’
A. vl .

‘Asi5a99prata2' 11. 11 461, Ἀσίῳ ἐν
λειμῶνι Καϋστρίου ἀμφὶ ῥέεθρα. ‘ Caystri '
with ‘ stagnis. The whole clause ‘ quae—
Caystri' is a literary amplificanon os
Aratus’ e ithet λιμναῖαι. .

385. ⁸ ores ² implies that they make lt
into spray.

386. Med. corn, Rom., Gud. have
‘undam'

387. ‘ In cassum‚' wantonly or without
object ; nearly the same notion as Aratus'
ἄπληστον, Varro’s ‘inexpleto studio.'
