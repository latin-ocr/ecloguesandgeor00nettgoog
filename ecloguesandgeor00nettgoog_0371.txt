five to seven feet where there is digging,
from seven to ten where there is ploughing.
. 356. Med. originally had ‘ submoveret

psgffl. ‘Flectere,’ i.e. to plough across
as well as up and down the lines of
vines; ‘ Transversis adversisque sulcis‚’
Col. l. c. This was made possible by the
regular intersecti avenues. Comp. vv.

planting'3 but he adds that this only
gnswers where the soil is unusually pro·
uctive.

‘ Vineta' is used in its proper sense,
the plural being natural in a precept,—
‘ Up and down your vineyardS.

‘ Luctantis,’ like ‘saepiusss ‘ duros,'
‘ presm,’ denotes the ains to be bestowed.

358. This would a most correspond to
the training of espalier vines (‘ pedatio,'
‘iugatio’), described by Col. 1v 12, etc.
But it is clear from v. 361 that the ‘ar-
busta ’ are still referred to, The ‘calami ’
seem to be the ‘harundines’ of Varro 1
8, which were used sor the ‘iuga,’ or
cross pieces, the ‘ rasae hastilia virgae‚’
. s ar-like wands made of peeled rods,
t e ‘hastilia de vepribus' of Columella.
Pal. has ‘ rassa’ (‘ rasa'). ⁹

pieces, which are forked at the top, the
other being inserted in them horizontally.

‘ Valentis’ is the reading of Med. , Rom. ‚
and others. The Verona fragm. has
‘ bicornis ’ (accepted by Heyne), which, as
Wagn. remarkS, is a mistaken repetition
from 1 264.

360. ‘Quarum viribu3,’ abl. instrum„
like ‘quarum auxilio.' ‘Eniti,’ climb.
Comp. v. 427, ‘ad sidera raptim Vi pro·
pria nituntur)

361. ‘ Tabulata,' storieS, the successive
branches os the elm to which the vines

were trained, intermediate boughs being
removed. They were to be at least three
seet apart‚ and were not to be in the same
perpendicular line, lest the cluster hang-
1ng from the ‘ tabulatum ’ above should be
injured by that below. Col. v 6, 11. ·

362·370. ‘ When the vine is quite
young, leave it alone. When it begins to
shoot out its branches, pluck off the

ull then, use the knife.’

362. The pruning of the vine, ‘pu-
tatio ' or ‘ pampinatio) There are three
period5, 1, when you must leave the young
vine entirely alone, 2, when you may
pluck off the leaves but not use the knise,
3, when you may use the knise. ‘ Novis
frondibus' is probably theablative. Comp.
Lucr. 111 449, ‘Inde ubi robustis adolevit
viribus aetas!

363. ‘Parcendum teneris : ’ the same
precept is given by Theo hr. (C. P. 111 9)
and Cato (xxxin), but ol. (iv 11) con·
demus it. With the structure of the pas·
sage Forb. comp. A. vu 354 foll.

‘ Laetus ² seems to quallfy ‘ agit,' as is
it had been ‘laetumff Comp. A. 1 314,
439, 11 388. ‘While the vine-branch is
pushing its way exultingl into the sky,
launched into the void in ἔιΙΙ career.’

364. ‘ Agit,’ used of growing upwardS,
as of growing downwards in the phrase
‘radices agere! Comp. vv. 291, 292.

‘ Laxis‚ etc. t comp. Lucr. v 786,
‘Arboribusque datum est variis exinde
per auras Crescendi magnum immissis
certamen habenis.’

‘ Per purum’ occurs Hor. od. 1 xxxiv
7, for a cloudless sky, like ⁴ ura sub
nocte,' E. lx 44. Used in t is sense
here, the word would be an unmeaning
