drains‚ and ‘ aquilices ’ for men employed

(and so Serv.)‚ except Rom. ‘fluentes.’
Probably ‘sequentis is a misreading of
⁴ recentis ’ and ⁴ fluentes ' a gloss upon that
word: Serv. A. vt 635 ‘recensz semper
fluens.’--H. N.]

⁴ Bibula harena ' might be referred with
Keightley [and most editors]‚ to the soil
from which (local abl.) the water is drawn,
called ⁴ harena' with reference to the

seems to require that it should be taken
instrumentally, so that it would refer to
the drains, which Col. 11 2 and others
recommend to have half filled with small
stones or ravel. Heyne refers to Dick·
