GEORGICON LIB. IV.

contemplator: aquas dulcis et frondea semper
tecta petunt. huc tu iussos asperge sapores,
trita melisphylla et cerinthae ignobile gramen,
tinnitusque cie et Matris quate cymbala circum:

ipsae consident medicatis sedibus, ipsae

intima more suo sese in cunabula condent.
Sin autem ad pugnam exierint—nam saepe duobus
regibus incessit magno discordia motu,

61. ‘Contemplator‚' 1 187.

‘,Huc' on some tree towards which
they may be tending‚ and to which you
wish to lure them.

‘,'1ussos ‘those which you. will have
been told‚' i. e. which Ι am going to tell
you. Comp. ν. 549, ‘monstratas excitat
aras3 Ἀ. x 444, ‘aequore iusso.' Rib-
beck reads ‘tussos‚ ' from a conj. of
§ecke s, ‘tunsos supported by v,

‘Sapores' refers rather to the smell than
to the taste, as the branches were to be
rubbed with the plants mentioned in the
next line. [⁴ Sopo ιεε, ’.Pal —H. N.]

63. ‘Melisphyllum, ' balm· in Lat.

‘pssffiimlist‘fflmi‘sgi‘ed‘hssy “331“1} ’ἒὶ
hilarg. antingu the Berney scholia, from
Varro 111 xvi. —H. N ]

‘Cerintha' [often supposed to be
cerintha aspera L., honeywort‚ but not
yet identified with any certainty. Bubani
p. 38. Pliny xxl 70 oells it ‘solio ean·
dido, incurvo, cubitaliS, ca ite concavo
mellis sucum habente, whic does not fit
the honeywort. ]

[Pal. has‘ carmen, ’perhaps a niistake
for‘ germen, as Burmann suspected.
H. N. ;orareminiscenceosE. 1x38.]

64. Another instance of Vi.rg’ s magni·
loquence, curiously contrasting with our
use of the key and warming· pan. The
reference is to the my thologi cal sto
which ιε indicated more yog¹fully v.150 fol.
The ancients were divided on the q·ues
tion whether the bees were srightened or
Eleased by the sound; Varro (111 xvi)

ol (lx vm 12) and Lucan (lx 288), held
the former opinion, Pliny (xx 68) and the
writer in Geopon. (xv 3) the latter.
Aristot. (H. A. lx 40) sa ys that they
snt *ιι msam} :e “⁶⁹3³
ἡδονὴν τοῦτο ποιοῦσιν (assemble aster

swarming)“ η διὰ φόβον.

65, 66. ‘Medicatis sedibus? i.e., the
branches so rubbed.

‘Cunabula’ pyrobabl refers to the hive
ιο which the bees are ιο be transferred, as

‘intima' seems to show.

[‘ Intuma’ Pal. -H. N.]

67-87. ‘When there are two kings in
the hive, there is'a battle. F irst there
are hoarse murmurs‚ alarms as if of a
trumpet. then the bees form round their
kings and issue forth into the air3 the
action lasts until one or the other party
is routed. You may stop it by sprinkling
dust among the combatants.'

67. Virg. evidently intended to give
directions as to what yshould be done by
the bee- -ιιεερει ιιι ιιιε case of a battle, as
he has just now laid down a rule to meet
the case of swarming. But he strikes at
onoc into a parenthesis which swells into α
regular description, and we can only col·
lect what the apodosis would have been
from vv. 86 fou. This· larity of
structure, as Forb. remarks, has doubtlew
a design, the poet throwing himselfinto the
enthusiasm of the subject, and sympathiz·
ing with his heroes.

‘Exierint’ refers to what has been said
tsszffiizstff’ ἑῖῗςὲῖἒξιὲἷ ιζ”ῗζῖᾓὲ
as is also shown by its position. ‘f ιι be
for battle that they have left the hive;

‘is their going out be for battle)

Other reasons for these conflicts are

as rivalry ιιι getting hone
actual want, when the inhabitants of one
hive will attack another (Aristot. H. A.
xx 4o); and isone nation loses its ueen,
the vanquished will combine wi the
victors-

‘Regibus' goes with‘ incessit?

ιίιιιοι insolitus incesserat’ and other pass·
