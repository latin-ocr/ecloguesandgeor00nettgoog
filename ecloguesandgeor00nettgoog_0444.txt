ipsis est aer avibus non aequus, et illae
praecipites alta vitam sub nube relinquunt.
praeterea iam nec mutari pabula refert,
quaesitaeque nocent artes; cessere magistri,

epithet is significant ς the shape os

animals from ollowing thern. Pal. has
‘ deprensa!

is ‘exterritus'

‘ Adstantibus ε ’ the force of the com·

erect their scales in terror or m fruitless

548-566. ‘ Remedies are in vain ε
horror and disease reign everywhere. The
bleatings and lowings of dying cattle are
heard all about3 the stalls are heaped
with dead, which have to be buried, sor
their flesh cannot be roasted or boiled‚
nor their hides or wool used for clothing
under penalty of contagion.'

548. ⁸ Mutari pabula‚’ seemingly of
changing their food‚ notos driving them
to pasture in another district.

taken in the sense of healing powers;
invented, if it merely mean expedients os
cure.

‘Cessere magistri’ recurs A. ΧΠ 717,
where the herdsmen retire from a combat
between two bulis, as here the healers
leave the field to the disease. [Med.
originally had ‘ cessare.’—H. N.]
