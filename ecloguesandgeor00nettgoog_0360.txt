P. VERGILI MARONIS

arboribus seges et quo mox digesta feratur,
mutatam ignorent subito ne semina matrem.
quin etiam caeli regionem in cortice signant,
ut, quo quaeque modo steterit, qua parte calores 270

‘ Locum similem ' then will be in appo·
sition alternately with each of the two
clauses that follow, ‘ubi . . . seges-»J and
‘quo . . . seratur,’ ‘ a like spot for the nur·
sery, anda like spot for the vineyard.' Or
we might explain the construction dif-
ferently, by saying that the poet used
⁸ similem ’ with a view to only one of the
two spots», the vineyard, which was to be
like the nursery, or the nursery, which
was to be like the future vineyard; and
that then, in explaining the comparison,
he expressed himself as if he had said,
⁴ Exquirunt duos locos, alterum alteri
similem, scilicet, ubi etc„ et quo’ etc.
For this change of view compare 1 421,
and faesch. Prom. 535, τρ (ξιαμφὲιδιον δέ

equally on ‘exquirunt ς’ each alike is to
be the ob‘ect of the husbandman’s search.

267. eightley supposes ‘similem' to
mean ‘ a soil like that m which the parent
vine stands,’ explaining vv. 269 foll.
similarly of transplanting intr), not from,
the nurseryg but this seems far less likely.
The ‘ seminarium ⁹ for vines is described
by Col. Arb. 1.

⁸ Arboribus seges : ' the vine-crop forits
supporters. The commentators, suppos·
ing Virg. to be speaking of the nursery
for vines in connexion with the vineyard
(which in the note on v. 2661have assumed
to be the case), universally understand
⁴ arboribus ⁹ of the vines. But such a use
os the word is unlikely both in itsels (see
v. 89 note) and still more in the present
context, for in vv. 289, 290 ‘ vitis' and
‘ arbos ’ are expressly distinguished. We
might evade the difficulty by supposing the
reference here to be not to vines at all,
but simply to their supporters, which had
a ‘ seminarium ’ of their own, from which
they’were transplanted into the ‘arbus-
{¹:¹3v³⁵⁶,²¹5v¹{1²3'{5;?;”pilzzitss‘fitss’szffa
of Virg. to their case. We should then
conclude that Virg. being anxiou5‚ as else·
where, to combine brevity with variety,
had passed from the vines to their sup-

rterS, leaving the treatment os the
ormer to be inserred, as it were, a fortiori.
This explanation might be certainly con-

firmed by Col. l. c., whose language is
founded on Virg.'s: ‘ Ne aliter arbores
constituamus quam quemadmodum in
seminario steterint ε plurimum enim refert
ut eam partem caeli spectent cui ab tenero
consueverunt) But such a transition
would create an inexcusable ambiguity.
Ι would suggest then that the sense of
‘ubi prima paretur arboribus seges' is,
‘where at first (‘prima’ = ‘primurm'
opposed to ‘ mox ‘) the vine-crop may be
got ready for its supporters,’ in other
words, may be prepared for afterwards
standing in the ‘ arl›ustum,'a description
of a nursery for vines, in which the poet
may have been thinking of a maiden being
tramed for a husband. This would further
avoid the necessity of changing the sense
of ‘ seges ’ in the two clauses and referring
it in the first to the soil os the nursery, in
the second to its contents.

‘ Digesta feratur' = ‘digeratur et sera-
tur,' or rather ‘ feratur et digeratur!
Comp. ν. 318, ‘Concretam radicem ad-
figere terrae.’ [Pal. originally had ‘feran-
tur. —H. N.

268. ‘ Thalt the sudden change may not
make the plants feel strangely to their
mother.' ‘ Subito ’ goes with ‘ mutatam.'
‘ Semina ’ arethe young vines ; seebelow,
v. 354, ‘ Seminibus positis.' The appli-
cation of the word to young trees is
common in the agricultural writers, and
is embodied in the word ‘ seminarium.'

‘ Matrem ' is the earth. Comp. A. xl
71, ‘Non iam mater alit tellus virisque
ministrat! Pliny xvn 69 ingeniously
distinguishes the ‘seminarium ’ and the
vineyard as ‘ nutrix ’ and ‘ mater.'

270. Pliny xvu 83 says that, as Cato
has made no mention of this practice, it is
probably valueless3 and adds that some
intentionally changed the position of vines
and figs when transplanted.

If we take the construction to be ‘ re·
stituant modum quo quae steterit,’ etc„
we shall not have to suppose a change of
construction at ‘quae terga obverterit,’
which is necess if we follow the com·
mentators in un erstanding ‘arbores’ as
the object of ‘restituant.' The manner
of the repetition also seems to indicate that
the several clauses are objects of the verb
