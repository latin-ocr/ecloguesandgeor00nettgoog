saevior erravit campiS, nec funera volgo

tam multa informes ursi stragemque dedere

per silvas; tum saevus aper, tum pessima tigris;

heu, male tum Libyae solis erratur in agris,

nonne vides, ut tota tremor pertemptet equorum 250

corpora, si tantum notas odor attulit auras?

ac neque eos iam frena virum, neque verbera saeva,
' non scopuli rupesque cavae atque obiecta retardant

flumina correptosque unda torquentia montiS.

⁸ Pictae ‘ is supposed by Forb. to be an
imitation of ‘variae volucre3,' which occurs
frequently in Lucr. (e.g. 11 344, a passage
not unlike this), but the epithet in Lucr-
means only ‘ variou3,' [see G. 1 383}

246. The persects are explained by ‘non
alio tempore.’ See 1 374.

⁸ Volgo,' v. 363 note. Here it seems
i. q. ⁸ late.’

247. ⁸ InformeS,’ on account of their
size, as well as their appearance, great
bulk being itselfa deformity, as involving
a departure from symmetry. So probably
⁸ tur , v. 52.

⁸ edere:’ ‘dare funera,‘ A. V111571 ;
⁸ dare stragem,' v. 556 below. ⁸ Edere ’ is
also used with both, A. lx 526. Comp. v.
265 ‘dant proelia.'

248. ⁸Pessima,' as ⁸ malus’ is used os
serpent5‚ vv. 416, 425.

249. ⁸ Heu, male tum mitis desendet
pampinus uva5,’ 1448. ‘Male erratur’
like ⁸ male creditur‚' Hor. S. 11 iv 21.

‘ Solis,’ though grammatically belonging
to ⁸ agris,’ really points to the traveller.

250-5. These lines are placed by Rib-
beck after v. 263, and vv. 264, 265 are
inserted before v. 258. It is easy however
to see that the passage loses by this at·
tempt to restore symmetry ; to pass gradu·
ally through the animals not treated of in
the -Georgics, ending in man, and then to
discriminate horses from mares is to do
what Virg. deliberately abstains from
doing 3 it is to assimilate the composition
of a didactic poem to that os a regular
treatise. Ribbeck believes vv. 250·254,
like some other difficult passages (see lv
291, etc.), not to have belonged to the
original draught of the poem, but to have
been added on revision and imperfectly
harmonized with the rest of the paesage.

250. ⁸ Nonne vides-‚⁸ 1 56. ‘Tremor
pgtemptat’ occurs Lucr. v1 287. [Pal.

· ‘et' for ‘ut.'—H. N.]

251. Heyne remarks that we might
rather have expected ⁸ aurae odorem attu-
lere-² As the scent comes with the gale,
Virg. chooses to make it the bearer, not the
borne, for the sake of variety.

252. ‘Iam’ implies that the sury has
risen beyond control.

‘Virum,' because other than human
obstacles are mentioned in the next verse.

⁴ Verbera saeva' is questioned by
Keightley, who remarks that no one
would beat a runaway horse to stop him.
Mr. Blackburn says, ‘Vir ., writing
loosely, enumerates some of t e common
methods os controlling horses without
caring sor the suitableness of all to the
particular case.’ [Virgil‚ writing loosely,
means perhaps in v. 252 to describe the
horse as masterless: ‘retardant’ is the
verb to this line only by zeugma. Hence
⁸ non iam ε’ the horse is no longer subJect
to the reins and the whip, and what might
still stop him, rocks and rivers, do not
affect him either. Marindin.]

253. Macrob., Sat. vt 2, cites a line
from Varius, which Virg. is said to have
imitated, ‘Non amnes illam medii, non
ardua tardant.’ See E. vm 89.

254. ⁸ Correptosque’: here, as else·
where, Virg. couples things not strictly
co·ordinate; A. 11 86, ‘comitem et con-
sanguinitate propinquum . . . misit3' xn
305, ⁸ Pastorem primaque acie per tela
ruentem!

‘ Torquentia montis ’ is a heightening of
the picture of Lucr. 1 288, ⁸ volvitque sub
undis grandia saxa) ⁸ Unda' may be
connected with either ‘torquentia ' or
correptos.’
