exception of a writer in the Quarterly Review and ΜΓ. Keightley,¹
who has set the matter in its true light. When CastelvetrO, in
the sixteenth century, asserted that the favourite trees of the
EclogueS, the beech, the ilex, the chestnut, and the pine‚ do not
grow about Mantua, Subsequent critics were ready to reply' that
the features of the country may have changed in the lapse of
centurieS, and that surely Virgil must know best. But such
reasoning will hardly avail against the absence of the green caves
in which the shepherd lies, or the briary crags from which his
goats hang, or the lofty mountajns whose lengthening shadows

remind him of evening. These are the unmistakable features of
Sicily, and no illusion os historica! criticism will persuade us that
they have changed their placeS, strange as it is to meet them in
conjunction with real Mantuan scenery, with the flinty soil of
AndeS, and the broad, lazy current of the Mincio. The actual
Mantua is surrounded by a lake: its pastoral counterpart, like
Shakspeare's Bohemia, seems to be on the sea, the stillness of
whose waters enables the shepherds to sing undisturbed, as in
Theocritus it forms a contrast with the unresting sorrow os the
love-sick enchantress The same rule, is rule it can be called, is
observed in the manners and institutions os the shepherds: there
is the Italian element, and there is the Sicilian, added, as it were,
to make it bucolic, The Pales os the Italians and the Apollo
Nomios of the GreekS, as Mr. Keightley again points out, retire
together from the country, which the death of Daphnis has left
desolate: the two high-days of the shepherds’ calendar are the
Greek festival os the Nymphs and the Roman Ambarvalia. lt
seems not improbable that a similar account is to be given os the
social position of the shepherds themselveS, wh0, though living
' on terms of Arcadian equality‚ appear to be sometimes slaves or
hirelingS, sometimes independent proprietors: but the status of
their brethren in Theocritus is itself a point which is apparently
Ξ involved in some uncertainty.
