Me. Lenta salix quantum pallenti cedit olivae,
puniceis humilis quantum saliunca rosetis,
iudicio nostro tantum tibi cedit Amyntas,

Mo. Sed tu desine plura, puer ;

be either the sculptor of Ov. M. xm
683, etc„ the Spartan hem, or the archer
of Val. Fl. 1 399. Codrus is doubtless
the same as in vu 22, 26, where he isthe
favourite of Corydon, the enemy of
Thsssis. Tbere is no inconsistency in
this transition from legendary to feigned
personage& The subject in each caseis
pastoral t the hero may or may not be.

12. ‘ Tityms,’ another herdsman. In
Theocr. 1 14 Th rsis offers to look after
the goats himsel , while the goatherd is
piping to him.

13. Voss takes ‘cortice’ os bark stript
from the tree, but ‘ viridi ' is 'nst this.
*η S hn refers to Calpurnius 1 33 oll.,where
’· 1 flag-six verses are represented as having
been cut on a tree, and to E. x 53, note.

14. ‘Setting them to music (‘modu·
lans ') marked the alternations of the flute
and voice (‘alterna notavi ')‚' [or perhaps
‘the ziltemation of song': see 111 593
vn 19 ·

15. Mopsus still feels the mention of

Amyntas, so Menalcas reassures him.
Pa1., Gud„ etc„ omit ‘ut τ’ but Lachm.
on Prop. 111 vi 43 thinks the elision neces·
sary on ounds of eu hon , so 1 have not
distur the receive rea in .
16, 17. Theocr. v 92. ‘ffie must re·
collect that the leaves of the willow ancl
the olive are of the same form, and os the
same pale green colour, while the differ·
enee in the value of the trees is immense.
The “saliunca‚'’ or Celtic reed, in like
manner roeembles the rose in odour, but
is so brittle that it could not be woven
into garlands, the great use made os the
rose by the ancients.’ Keightley.

19·44. ‘Ma Here we are in the cave.
-A Daphnis’ death the nymphs wept—

his mother clasped his body and called re·

roachfully on heaven— the cattle were not
ed or watered-—the very lions roared out
their grief. Yes-—he was the tamer of
tigers, the founder of the rural worship of
Bacchus—he was the glory os his friends
-now that he is gone, there is a curse on
the land, and weeds spring where good
seed was sown. Let us make his tomb
and write his epitaph.'

19. ⁴ Desine plura,’ a confusion os ‘ de-
sine loqui ' and ⁸ parce plura loqui.' Rib-
beck’s MSS. give this line to Menalcas:
but on such a point their authority is worth
little. [Bentley, Ribbeck, Thilo, however,
follow them.]

20. DaphniS, the ideal she herd, may
here all orically represent Ju ius Caesar 3
see the ntroduction. Daphnis was the
favourite of the nymphs. Theocr. 1 66,
141. [‘Daphnin Rom—H. N.]

21. ‘ Flebant’ with a pause after it, at
the beginning of the verse, as in A. vl
213, to give a melancholy effect.

23. ‘ Atque—atque ' seems to be for
‘ et—et,' as in Sil. 1 93, ⁸ Hic crine effuso
atque Ennaeae numina divae Atque Ache·
ronta vocat Stygia cum veste sacerdos)
[These seem to be the only two exx. ς see G.
111257. The roeent line looks like anex-
periment for e ect.] To take ‘ complexa ³
as a finite verb would be somewhat tame.

⁸ Crudelia' is best taken with ‘vocat‚’
as Wagn„ ‘ denounces their cruelty aloud.’

‘Astra,' the birth-star. If Caesar is
Daphnis, contrast lx 46 foll„ where
Caesar has his own constellation. The
position of ‘ mater ' at the end of the
sentence must not be overlooked· in trans-
lation. Perha we may render ⁸ while
his mother, c asping to her heart the
