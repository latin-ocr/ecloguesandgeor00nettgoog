64 P. VERGILI MARONIS

ECLOGA V. [DAPH NIS.]

MENALCAS. MOPSU S.

MENALCAS invites Mopsus, a somewhat younger shepherd, to play and sing. Mopsus
complioe with a funeral song on Daphnis, the ideal shepherd. Menalcas matches
it hy a song on Daphnis’ apotheosis. They praise each other, and exchange gifts.

In the introduction, which contrasts with that to Ecl. 111, being an interchange of
courtaeies, not of scurrilities, Virgil follows the first Idyl of Theocritus: in the form
of the singing·match, the sixth and ninth, as also to a certain extent in the conclusion.
The subject of the songS, too, bears a relation to the first Idyl, where Thflsis sings of ¹
the dying hours of Daphnis, a hero of pastoral mythology, the beloved of the nymphS,
and victim of the wrath of Aphrodite. The story, which is variously related, seems
to have been taken up by Virgil where the other narrators dropped it. This of itself
favours the notion that Daphnis is intended to represent some other person; other·
wise there would be no object in imagining an apotheosis sor him. If we are to seek
for any such person, it must be the dictator Caesar, an opinion which was current in
the time of ServiuS, though [Suetonius assures us that it is Virgil’s brother Flaccus
who is meant, and Servius adds that others thought of Quintilius Varusfflor. od. 1
24)] and others of the mythical Daphnis. The apotheosis would be extravagant in
the case of a private individual, but answers sufficiently well to the honours decreed
to Caesar soon after his death, the placing of his statue in the temple of Venus
Genetrix, the change of the name of the month Quintilis to Julius, and the com·
memoration of his birthday in the calendar. In the preceding Eclogue Virgil has
shown himself disposed to celebrate political and social regeneration under pastoral
images: in Ecl. tx 46, which the mention of Daphnis, though only as a shepherd,
slightly connects with the present poem, he displays his sympathy with Caesar in
particular as the shepherd’s supposed patron. This symbolizing is merely a result of
the identification of the poet with the shepherd (see the Introduction to the Eclogues),
persons and things affecting the former being described as affecting the latter, just as
Gallus in Ecl. X, being the shepherd poet's friend, is made a shepherd himself ; so
that in maintaining it we are not, as Keightley thinks, committed to the position
‘that Virgil, who was perhaps the least original poet of antiquity, was the inventor of
a new species of poetry.' At the same time we need not be anxiouS, like certain
critics mentioned by Servius, to find a meaning in every detail, as if the lions and
tigers stood sor the nations subdued by Caesar, or the lovely flock which Daphnis fed
sor the Roman people.

The date of the Eclogue can only be fixed with reference to Ecl. 11 and 111 (see
v. 86), which are earlier than it, but we may conjecture that it was written soon after
the order by the triumvirs for the commemoration of Caesar's birthday‚ in 42. [Thilo
points out, further, that Cornificius, who criticised v. 36, died in 41.] Virgil seems to
identify himself with Menalcas, as in Ecl. tx. Servius finds an historical counter·
part for Mopsus in Aemilius Macer, a poet of Verona. The scenery is again from
Theocritus, For the structure of the poem see Introduction to Ecl. vul.
