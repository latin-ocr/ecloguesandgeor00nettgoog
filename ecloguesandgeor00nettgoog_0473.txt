rustic writers, may show that Virg. does
not think os sparmg all the honey, but
only of leaving a portion. In that case,
the pity expreesed in the next line may be
for the injury already done by depriving
them of part of their store ς in the other,

‘ Thymo ι’ fumigation is prescribed by
Varro 1. c. and Co . lx 14, m connexion
with precepts about cleansing the hive-
The latter recommends coar-dung, whence
Schrader con'eetured ‘ fimo ’ here. Flo-
rentinus in deep. xv 3 speaks of fumi·
gation with thyme and κνέωρσν as a means
of attracting thern back to the hive. From
the two former writers it would appear
that fumigation is recommended partly as
a means of purification, partly as grateful
to the bees, not, as some have thought,
with ‚⁸ view to expelling or destroying the
vermin.

tice varied: ‘Messallinus’ (comm.
ffifsaec. 152) might, like ‘ millia ’ (Mon.
Amyn), be a whim of AugustuS, but
Pollio is usually so spelt (E. 111 84 note).
Lachmann elaims ‘ stelio ' as an instance,
deriving it from stilla: it may, however,
be derived from ‘ stella’ or the vulgar
‘ stela ’ (Schuchhardt). Both ‘ stellio ² and
‘stelio' occur in MSS„ the latter more
often: see Georges Wortformen s.v.]

‘Lucifuga'or ‘lucifugus’ is used as a
term of reproach by Lucil. xtv 3, ‘suit
lu ⁰ ‚ nebulo.’ An insect ‘ soli·
suga' is mentioned by Solinus, c. 43
but the word is probably an error of his
sor ‘ solipuga ’ or ‘ salpuga.' [The ‘ soli-
fuga '·is described by Solinus as ‘animal

Keightley thinks it clear from Pliny
xl 99 that the ‘ blatta' was the black-
beetle (oockroach), of which the modern
scientific name is also ⁸ blatta.’
