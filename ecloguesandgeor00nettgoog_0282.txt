countries shall produce all thingS, and
the strength of man and beast no more
be put under requisition.

64. ‘ Pingue ' emphatic, as v. 67 shows.

65. ⁴ Fortes ' emphatic, like ‘ validis
terram proscinde iuvenci5,’ 11 237. The
rhythm of the line is obviously intended
to suit the sense.

‘ Iacentis,’ upturned by the plough and
lying exposed to the sun. The word pro-
bably indicates that there should be a
second ploughing or &oss-gloughing in
summer. See on vv. 47, 4 , and comp.
11 261, ‘Ante supinatas Aquiloni ostendere
glaebas! ‘ Let the clods be ex for
summer to bake them to dust wit its full
mellow suns.'

[‘ Invortant' Med. originally.-H. Ν.]

66. ⁶ Maturis ’ of full midsummer heat3

but it seems also to contain the notion of
actively ripening. Rom. has ‘frugibuS,’
doubtless from v. 69. Serv. says ‘ipsius
manu adiectum “maturis solibus,” re

senii} to some copy supposed to be cor·

recte by Virg. himself.
67. So Col. 11 4, ⁸ Graciles clivi non

sunt aestate arandi, sed cirea Septembres
Calendas: quoniam si ante hoc tempus
proscinditur, effeta et sine suco humus
aestivo sole peruritur, nullasque virium re·

apparently supersedes both winter an

summer ploughing: Col. however adds,

that the ploughing must be repeated shortly

after, so that sowing may take place at q

the beginning of· theequinoctial rmns.

68. ‘Non. Septemb. Arcturus-exoritur: tremewiew-of the le

‘ Suspendere tellurem,' not ⁴ aratrum?
⁸ Neque enim parum refert suspensissi-
mum esse pastinatum [solum], et, si fieri
possit, vestigio quoque inviolatum,' Col.
111 13, who immediately afterwards talks
of ‘vineam in summa terra suspendere,’
as opposed to planting deep. The notion
of raising seems to have come from that
os holding up in air: comp. A. vn 810,
‘fluctu suspensa tumenti.’ [Pallad. 1 xxi ι,
‘ stabula ab omni umore sus ’-H.N.]
At the same time the passages os Col.
apparently show that it is not sim ly i. q.
‘tollere‚' but im lies that the t g is
done l htly, perhaps with reference to
such phrases as ‘ suspenso gradu ' or
‘ suspensa manu.’

69. ‘mic’ refers to vv. 6466, ‘hic’
to vv. 67, 68. ⁶ Laetis,’ as the quality
of the soil would make the corn luxuriant.
Forb. comp. 11 251, ‘Umida maiores
herbas alit, i que iusto Laetior)

Serv. on 7 says ⁴ Ipsius manu adiecti
sunt, deletis duobm, quorum alter totus
legi potuit, “ Illic officiant segetes ne
frugibus inis,” ex altero hoc tantum “ne
deserat umor harenam,’' ' words which

can hardly belong to any passage but the “
resent.

p 71-83. ⁴ Let your land lie fallow every

the crops, and

so relieve the soil at e same time that

you turn it to some account.’

71. ‘It can hardly be mant that the
land was to be let lie idle an entire year 3
for in· that case there would be only one

get a scurf of weeds till the follo '

uotes a passage from Simond's Travels
in Italy and Sicily, showi that the ex-
