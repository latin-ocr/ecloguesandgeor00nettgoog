ΝΟΤΕ ΟΝ THE SCENERY ABOUT MANTUA.

Readers of Eustace’s Classical Tour through Italy may remember that while assert-
ing that ‘ Virgil's pastorals ought in general to be considered not as pictures of real
scenery . . . . but as mere lusus poetici composed in imitation of Theocritus,’ he
excepts the descriptive passages in the First, Seventh, and Ninth Ecloguae, and dis-

covers the place
. ‘ qua se subducere colles

incipiunt, mollique iugum demittere clivo ’

in the neighbourhood of ValeggiO, ‘ near which town they (the hilis) begin to subside,
and gradually lose themselves in the immense plain of Mantua.’ There, and nowhere
else on the banks of the Minciu3‚ he finds the rocks», cragS, and mountains of the first
Eclogue. (Your, vol. i pp. 217 foll„ third edition.) 1 have applied to Mr. Keightley
on the subject, and have pleasure in extracting part of the answer with which he has
favoured me. ‘ All 1 cau tell you is that on my arriving in Mantua in company with
two French gentlemen, whose sight was better than mine, we all asceuded the Torrc
di Gabbia to view the surrounding country, which Ι swept with a good opera-glass,
and we came, without a moment's hesitation, to the conclusion expressed in p. 15 of
my Virgil. 1 had intended walking out to Pietola‚ but from the view Ι had of it 1
saw that it would be quite a work of supererogation. Next day a gentleman who
resided in Cremona accompanied us to Milan, when, finding that he was a sportsman
and was in the habit of traversing the country in all directions, 1 asked him about
rock5‚ etc.‚ and he assured me there was no stone at all in the plain—nothing but
gesse, sulphate of lime.’

1 ought also to mention that, according to Eustace, ‘ the “ spreading beech ’⁹ still
delights in the soil and adorus the banks of the Mincius in all its windings.’

So far as Virgil is concerned, it is obvious that the question is an unimportant one,
as it is admitted on both sides that the scenery of the Eclogues is generally Theocritean,
but that the actual features of the Mantuan district are represented in one or two

exceptional instance&
