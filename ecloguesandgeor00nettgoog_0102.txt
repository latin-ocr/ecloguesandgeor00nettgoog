xcviii THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

A. 1x 131, et est oratorium quaestiones ita proponere ut facilem solu·
tionis sortiantur eventum 3 compare on line 136.

A. lx 481, et est conquestio matris Euryali plena artis rhetoricae.
Nam paene omnes partes habet de misericordia commovenda a Cicerone
in Rhetoricis positas.

A. lx 614, utitur argumentis quae in Rhetoricis commemorat
Cicero.

A. x 36, nunc per ἀντικατηγορῶν ad accusationem alterius transit ε
ib. 38, secundum artem rhetoricam rem unam in duas divisit.

F inally 1 may refer the curious reader to the long criticism on A. xl
243 foll.

lt would be interesting to know whether the fourth book of Macro—
bius, and remarks such as those which Ι have quoted from Servius, were
· taken from the book of our rhetorical worthies, Titianus and Catulinus.¹
Whether this is the case or n0, there can be no doubt that this style of
criticism is one of which Probus or any of the older commentators
would have been ashamed, and is the characteristic offspring of an age
in which all creative effort has died out.

It is in all respects more profitable to study the material common to
ἐ the Verona scholia, PhilargyriuS, Macrobius, and Servius: material
' which 1 suppose to be, so to speak, the deposit which the scholarship of
the first and second century had left. In dealing with this matter it is
noticeable that the commentary of ServiuS‚ as compared with the notes
of Macrobius or the Verona scholia, tends to abbreviate, to curtail, and
to omit the names of authorities. Servius is on the whole a sound, but
he is not a full commentator ; and we should be fortunate indeed could
we exchange all his work for the Verona scholia in their complete
form. The value of his commentary is derived almost entirely from
what it preserves of the earlier Roman scholarship 3 and the amount of

thiS‚ judging by what a comparative method enables us to detect, is not
inconsiderable.

19. THE BERNE SCHOLIA.²

These scholia profess to be copied from Roman commentaries (de
commentariis Romanorum) by a Scot named Adanan, whom Ribbeck
and Teuffel (472, 9) assign to the eighth century. This writer names
as the three commentators from whom he has made extractS, Titus
Gallus, Gaudentius, and Iunilius Flagrus of Milan. Iunilius Flagrus,
who is mentioned by the compilet as his chief authority, is now generally
identified by scholars with Iunius Philargyrius ς a conclusion borne out
by the general coincidence between the notes bearing the names of
Philargyrius and FlagruS.

The compilet of these scholia was a Christian and fond of alle·
