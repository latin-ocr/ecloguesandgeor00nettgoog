P. VERGILI MARONIS

altera frumentis quoniam favet, altera Bacch0,
densa magis Cereri, rarissima quaeque Lyaeo:

ante locum capies oculiS, alteque iubebis

2 30

in solido puteum demitti, omnemque repones

rursus humum, et pedibus summas aequabis harenas,
si derunt, rarum pecorique et vitibus almis

aptius uber erit; sin in sua posse negabunt

ire loca et scrobibus superabit terra repletis,

spissus ager; glaebas cunctantis crassaque terga
expecta, et validis terram proscinde iuvencis,
salsa autem tellus et quae perhibetur amara—

as if it meant excessively. The meaning
evidently' ι5 whether the earth* ιιι question
is looser or stiffer than the average.

sion of the order must be set down as

229. agis’ seems to belong to
‘ densa. ’ This answers best to‘ rarissima
quaeque.'

230. ‘Ante locum capies oculis’ is ex·
plained by‘ in solidoss which gives the
reason for the choice.

234. ‘Uber’ is a laudatory synonym
for‘ solum.’

235. ‘Scrobibus: ‘'scrobes is here
used as a synonym for‘ puteus’; rather
loosely, sor ‘'scrobes as a general rule
were excavations longer than they were
broad, such as a trench for vines, or a

grave. Col. v 5 allowS, as an exception,

the ‘scrobs' sor vines to be as broad
as it is long. ‘Scrobibus’ is plural for

singular.
‘us rabit'= ‘supererit.’ The word.
as ιι intrans„ seems first to mean ‘to

be superior; ’t’hen‘ to be in excess;
lastly‘ to remain over, ’without the notion
of exceSS‚ as Ε. lx 27, ‘superet modo
Mantua nobis.' Possibl there may be
here the further notion ο elevation in the
soil, which would sall under the first of
the meanings given, as in Stat. Theb. ιν
458, ‘ Quamquam infossus humo, superat
tamen agger in auras) In ν. 314 below
the third meaning seems to be intended 3
in v. 330 the first or second. See also
ιιι 63, Α. 1 537, 11311.

Pliny throws doubt on the practicability
os this test (xvu 27), ‘Scrobes quidem
regesta in eos nulla complet, ut densa
atque rara ad hunc modum deprehendi

po⁴236, 237. The epithets ‘cunctantiS, ’
‘ crassa,’ ‘validis,’ are emphatic. ‘Pre-

gr ‘Ex pecta’ ‘'exerce was read originally
in one os Ribbeck' 5 cursives, and ι5 sup·

238. liny xvn 29 gives a more favour-
able view of this kind os soil: ‘ Salsae
terrae multo melius creduntur, tutiora a
vitiis innascentium animalium. '

‘Perhibetur’ seems to denote that
‘ amara’ is a common epithet of soils.
Diophanes ιιι Geopon v 7, recommending
a similar test os soil, speaks of τὴν γεῦσιν

πικρὰν η ἁλμυρόν.
