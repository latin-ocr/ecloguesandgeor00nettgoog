P. VERGILI MARONIS

montibus et silvis studio iactabat inani: 5
O crudelis Alexi, nihil mea carmina curas?
nil nostri miserere? mori me denique coges,

s nunc etiam pecudes umbras et frigora captant;
[nunc viridis etiam occultant spineta lacertoS, r'v ,⁴ ·
Thestylis et rapido fessis messoribus aestu 10 ⁸·

alia serpullumque herbas contundit olentis,
at mecum raucis tua dum vestigia lustr0,
sole sub ardenti resonant arbusta cicadis
nonne fuit satiuS‚ tristis Amaryllidis iras

to mean artles8, like ‘ versibus incomtis‚’
G. 11 86.

‘ Solus ' is better than ‘ soli3‚’ a plausible
conjecture of Drakenborch’s, as making
Corydon the principal object. So Prop.
1 xviij 30, ‘ Cogor ad argutas dicere solus
aves.

5· ‘lassabat-..tami A· 11 588, ‘Talia
iactabam et furiata mente ferebar.'

‘ Inani,’ bootless, because it was ⁴ mon-
tibus et silvis) It expresses also a pro-
longed purposeless lament, like ‘ incassum, ’
G. 1 387, ‘nequiquam‚’ ib. 403.

6-18. ‘Alexis, 1 am desperate: ffiid:

ἓειχ and every-thiu living sheltets its-elf-

rom the heat3 xetfsam wandering under
the sun in the hope of findiu you. Never

Eia-T h’n'd the sco'r'n of aqoved one so
hard to bear. You may be more lovely
than others, but do not presume on it.’

6. Theocr. 111 6, ὦ χαρίεσσ’ Ἀμαρυλλί,
id. x1 19, ὦ λευκὰ Γαλάτεια.

7. Theocr. ιιι 9, ἀπάγξασθαί με ποιη-
σεῖς. ‘ Coges ⁹ Rom„ which agrees with
kdeniquess and is supported by Theocr.
‘ Cogis ’ Pal„ Gud.

8. ‘ Iam pastor umbras cum grege lan·
guido Rivumque fessus quaerit,’ Hor. Od.
111 xxix 213 ‘ patula cus omne sub ulmo
est,’ Pers· 111 6; &th descriptions of
noon. In ‘ captant ’ and ‘ occultant,' as
Keightley remarkS, the frequentative may
denote the multitudes seekin shelter.

9. Theocr. v11 22, ‘Avium ὴ καὶ σαῦρος
‘ Rubum Dimo-

ἐφ’ αἱμασιαῖσι καθεύδει. ι La

vere lacertae,' Hor. Od. 1 xxiii 6.

certas ' is the original reading of Pal.
ιο. ‘Rapido aestu:' ‘rapidus' in its

original sense seems to be ⁰621&ss sym-

r n e of ‘ ἕξεως.) Hence st is applied to
&ming seas, fire, and the scorching

sun. Keightley on E. vn 66 has collected
instances where ⁴ ra ’ and ‘ rapidus '
appear to be used in ifferently of seas and

rivers. In Lucr. lv 712 the MSS. give

easily such criticism’ may be pushed into
an extreme. The meaning ‘swist ' pro-
bably flows from ‘ rapere‚' m the sense of
‘ hurrying away.’

‘ Thestylis‚’ Theocr. 11 1.

11. She was making for them the mess
called ‘ moretum,' which is described in
the pseudo-Virgilian of that name.
It was composed of flour, cheese, salt, oil,
and various herbs (⁶ herbas olentis ') brayed
together in amortar. Keightley. Horace
in his phffisspic against garlic, Epod. 111
4, says, ‘O uta messorum ilia l' ‘Olentis '
is ἓρέἒίεῗ equally tt} tthhe stench of garlic
an e rance o e.

12. ‘1 artigi the cicalasyffone are stirn'ng) '
‘ Cioedis ' is the real subiect, to be eoupled,
with ‘ mecum,’ though arbusta’ is made
the grammatical subject by the turn of the
expression, and ⁶ mecum resonant arbusta
cicadis' is equivalent to ‘ mecum canunt
cicadae!

‘ Mecum,' like me, is found in G. 1 41,
11 8. But the sense here is not only
with or like me, but with me alone ε and
we may compare the use of ‘ mecum,'
‘tecum,’ ‘secum,’ for ‘ by myself,' etc.
Rom. has ⁴ ac mecum.' [Ribbeck now
follows Bentley and prints ‘ me cum.’]

‘ Tua vestigia) Corydon isttying to find
Alexis, whom he supposes to be flying
from him, vv. 60, 63, and examining his
fbotprints. So ‘vestigia lustrat,' A. xl 763.

13. Comp. G. 111 338, where the ‘ci-
cadae ' are loud at the fourth hour before
the ‘aestus medii ' (v. 331). ‘ Arbusta ’
herefi, as there, are probably natural, not
arti cial.

14. ‘ Amaryllidis iraS,’ 111 80.
