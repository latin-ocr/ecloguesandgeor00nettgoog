‘ et ad auras,' fill the air with his
song3 comp. A. vl 561, ‘quis tantus
plangor ad auras?' The description, as
Spohn remarkS, points to the month ot'
August, from the mention not only of
the ‘frondatio’ (comp. G. 11 400, Col.
xl 2), but of the cooing of the wood-
pigeons during. incubation. See note on
next verse. · ‚

cooing of the wood-pigeons a sign that
autumn is coming on, xvnl 267, ‘ Palum-
bium utique exaudi gemitus. Transisse
solstitium caveto putes, nisi cum incuban·
tem videris palumbem.’

their farms, Varro R. R. 111 8, Cot.

and nations their seatS, before Ι forget my

59. ‘ Ergo' is resumptive. as in G. lv
206 (note), Meliboeus’ speech forming a
parenthesis.

One inferior MS. has ‘in aequore'
[which is accepted by Ribbeck, who quotes
Ovid Met. xlv 37, Calpurn. v11175.] But
this (besides its want of authority) would
not agree with ‘ levaess with which Wagn.

Germans and Celts. At all events the
error, whatever it may amount to, is
Virg.'s own, and not a dramatic touch of
rustic ignorance. Those who make such
defences should remember that a poet had
better commit a blunder in geography
than a platitude.

63. ‘ Before 1 forget the gracious look
he gave me.’ The notion seems to be
that of a god's benign countenance.
‘ Cultus ’ is an ingeniouS, but by no means
necessary conjecture. A correction in
Pal. has ‘ labantur.'
