INTRODUCTION. 143

his own when he spoke of himself as singing the song of Ascra
through the towns of Rome. The Iliad and Odyssey, if modern
criticism will allow us to enjoy them in their integrity, might
easily be shown to possess most of those requisites which the
writer of the Aeneid and the grammarians whom he not im-
probably followed doubtless considered the invariable elements
of an epic poem z but even though the Works and Days should
be judged to have successfully resisted the solvent power of
German analysiS, its relation as a whole to the Georgics must
still be regarded as one of contrast rather than of similarity.
But where a poet avows himself an imitator, traces of imitation
are not likely to be wanting in his work: and though Virgil has
not followed Hesiod as closely or as constantly as he has followed
Theocritus or Homer, the instances of resemblance between them
in points of detail are neither few nor equivocal. Even the per-
vading philosophy, if so it may be called, of the Works and
DayS, the philosophy of labour, reappearS, with no perceptible
loss of reality, as the animating soul of the Georgics, though the
plain directness with which it is enforced in the one affords a
significant contrast to the artful dexterity with which it is in-
sinuated in the other. The picture of the Five Ages doubtless
suggested Virgil's lines on the transition from the reign of
Saturn to the reign of Jove, which in their turn supplied some
hints to Ovid when he set himself to reproduce the Hesiodic
narrative at the opening of his Metamorphoses The story of
Prometheus has no counterpart in Virgil, except so sar as it may
have taught him that an episode may fumish an agreeable relies
in didactic poetry‚ and so have given rise to the narratives which
conclude his third and fourth books ; but the moral of the story,
the duty of submitting to a dispensation in which those who
would live must labour, is identical with the lesson which he
draws from his briefer view of the legendary antiquities of his
subject. The description of the plough is from Hesiod, though
the later poet, in spite .of his evident anxiety to attainexactness
of detail, does not come up to the sulness of the earlier. The
very meagreness of Virgil's paragraph (1 276) about the lucky
and unlucky dayS, whether it be true or no that the precise sub7
stance of it is borrowed from another writer, may induce us to
