PREFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.

THE first three editions os this volume were the work os Mr.
Conington. The fourth edition was revised and enlarged by
Mr. Nettleship. The orthography was recast, references adapted
to recent textS, additional notes inserted, and four elaborate
essays prefixed to the commentary by way of a general intro-
duction.

The present edition differs in several ways from its pre-
decessor. Mr. N ettleship at his death left some Marginalia,
and my first task has been to incorporate these materials. They
are indicated by square brackets with the initials H. N ., as Mr.
Nettleship himself indicated his additions in the fourth edition.
At ,the same time 1 have added to, corrected, or condensed the
commentary as seemed desirable in a work which had in many
parts remained unaltered since it was published· forty years
ago. I have tried to take account of the contributions made to
Virgilian studies since 1884, for instance Ribbeck’s new edition,
Thilo’s edition and the first volume of his ‘ Servius: Hoffmann's
collation of the Medicean manuscript, the writings of Deuticke
and others The critical noteS, some of which dated from the
era before Ribbeck, have been recast, and the text has been
altered to that which Mr. Nettleship prepared for Dr. Postgate's

Corpus Poetarum Latinorum. I have slightly added to the
Introduction, by enlarging the section on the text with what, Ι

hope, may be convenient details. 1 have also reconstructed the
Index. Square brackets without initials indicate generally my
additions, but 1 have not been over-caresul to label minutiae or
new matter which, like that in the section on the text, is purely
an amplification of the old. Externally I have tried to make the
commentary more readily useful by breaking up long notes into
appropriate paragraphs, and the publishers have given the book
