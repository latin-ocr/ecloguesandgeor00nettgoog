P. VERGILI MARONIS

confluere et lentis uvam demittere ramis.

Haec super arvorum cultu pecorumque canebam
et super arboribu3‚ Caesar dum magnus ad altum 560
fulminat Euphraten bello, victorque volentis
per populos dat iura, viamque adfectat Olympo.
illo Vergilium me tempore dulcis alebat

‘Arbore’ is local; ‘confluere ’ is used
as if ‘ in arborem ¹ had preceded.

558. ‘Uvam demittere ’ is doubtlaes
8 ested by βοτρυδὸν δὲ πέτονται, 11.

559-566. ‘ So ends my rural poem,
written while Caesar is winni glories in
the East, in my retreat at Nugas, by me,
poet of the Eclogues.'

These lines, though found in all MSS.
[and known to Servius, the Reme scholia,
etc.], have been condemned by some critics
as the productiori of a grammarian, like
the four lines fixed to the Aeneid in
some late MS . Such summaries were
frequently produced as exercises by later
writers, while they are uncommon in the
undoubted works of poets themselves. But
the unanimity of the MSS. [and other
authorities] is an argument not easy to
rebut‚ while the lines may be vindicated on
their own ground as completing a poem
which would otherwise wear an unfimshed
air, and as containing nothing unworthy os
Virg. The poet had begun with Caesarg
he now ends with him, contriving at the
same time to institute a kind os parallel
between the laurels which the master of
the world has been winning in Asia and
the more peaceful triumphs which the
Muse has been achievi at N aples. He
may have taken the int os an auto-
biographical conclusion from some Alex-
andrine writer, for the two extant works
of Nicander both end with a couplet in
which the writer recommends himself by
name to the reader’s notice. The conclu-
sion of Ovid’s Metamorphoses furnishes
indirect evidence to the genuineness os the
lineS‚ aS, if not actually modelled on thern,
it shows at any rate that the spirit of sels-
assertion which breathes in both was not
foreign to the Roman try of that
period. Other critics, o whom Heyne
ts one, have been satisfied with rejecting
the four last lines, a view less consistent
than the other, and equally⁷ unsupportefl.

559. ‘Haec canebam: a formula like

that at the end ol a letter, ‘Haec tibi
dictabam post sanum putre Vacunae,'

Hor. Ep. 1 x 49. Wagn. comp. Ε. x 7ο,
‘Haec sat erit, divae, vestrum cecinisse
poetam,’ which he regards as the finale os
the whole book of EclogueS.

‘ Super cultu,' like ‘super Priamo
rogitans,' A. 1 750. ‘ Scribere super re ’
is used by Cic. Att. Χνι 6.

[⁸ Cultus ’ the St. Gall fragm.—H. N.]

560-562. The period referred to in these
lines is that os Octavian's progrem in the
East after Actium. The meaning is
evidently that the poem was finished while
these Eastern operations were taking

place. See p. 164.

561. ⁸ F ulminat,' like ‘ fulminat Aeneas
armis’ A. x11654; the Scipios are mlled
‘fulmina belli ’ Lucr. 111 1034, A. vt 842.

⁴ Bello' is abl. instrum. as ‘armis' in
A. xit 654.

[⁸ Bello ' and ‘ Euphraten ’ are both used
loosely, like ¹ extremis Asiae oris ’ 11 171.
For the actual details see Merivale (ed. 1)
iii 358, Mommsen R. G. v 370-2.]

562. ⁴ Iura ⁸ [gives judgrnent‚ i.e. mles ε
comp. Bell. Alexandr. 78,‘iurain tetrarchas
reges civitates distribuit‚’ referring also to
Octavian in 29. So A. 1 293, ⁶ iura
dabunt‚’ shall rule the world, v 758, vn
246, v111 670, I-lor. Od. 111 iii 44, etc.-
H. N. For a different sense of ‘iura ' see
11 {⁵215}th viam3’ so Ter. Ad. v viii 71
‘ hi gladiatorio ammo ad me adfectant
viam,’ [twice in PlautuS, twice in Terence,
Cic. Rosc. Am. 48, etc.‚ to move towards]
Caesar is described as making his way to
actual immortality (1 503), not as a god on
earth (1 42).

‘ Olympo ’ dative, like ‘ it clamor eaelo '
A. v 451, G. 11 306, etc.

563. The contrast between Caesar and
the poet, hinted in the previous linea, is
