tecta serat late circum, cui talia curae;
ipse labore manum duro terat, ipse feracis

figat humo plantas et amicos inriget imbris,

‘Inriget imbrisz' like ‘quietem inri-

ancients had roses like ours.

118. ‘ Colendi ’ is almost pleonastic.

119. The rosaries of Paestum are a
commonplace among the Latin poets, Ov-
M. xv 708, Prop. v (1v)v 61. Tenore,
quoted by Keigfflley, says that, as he has
never met with twice-blowing reses round
Paestum, it is probably of cultivated
reses that Virg. speaks.

‘ Rosaria’ may depend either on ‘or-
naret ‘ or on ⁶ canerem.’
