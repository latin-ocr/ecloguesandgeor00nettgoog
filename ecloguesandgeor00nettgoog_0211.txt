talis amor teneat, nec sit mihi cura mederi.

ducite ab urbe domum, mea carmina, ducite Daphnim.
has olim exuvias mihi perfidus ille reliquit,

pignora cara sui; quae nunc ego limine in ipso,
terra, tibi mando; debent haec pignora Daphnim.
ducite ab urbe domum, mea carmina, ducite Daphnim. 95
has herbas atque haec Ponto mihi lecta venena

ipse dedit Moeris; nascuntur plurima Ponto.

his ego saepe lupum fieri et se condere silvis
Moerim, saepe animas imis excire sepulchris

atque satas alio vidi traducere messis

‘ perdita’ in particular suggests the aban·
donment of love more naturally than
reckless ursuit, and it isundoubtedly much
more eflEctive when hanging, as it were,
between two clauses (a position with
which Forb. aptly comp. A. tv 562),
than when necessarily attached to the
latter. With ‘perdita’ Keightley comp.
11 59.

‘Decedege nocti’ occurs again G. 111
467 sioni-p. 1decedere calori, G. lv 23,
and Gray’s ‘leaves the world to darkness
and to me.' Perha Virg. or Varius
may have thought ofsl-Iomsss πειθώμεθα
νυκτὶ μελαίνῃ (11. vm 502).

90. With ‘talis amor Daphnim—talis
amor teneat,’ comp. vv. 1, 5.

92-95. ‘ These things which he has left
1 will bury at the door, in the hope that
they will brin him back.'

‘ Pe dus ille,' A. ιν 421. .

93. ‘ Pignora' seems to imply that
they were left purposely, not by accident.
⁸ Limine in ipso,’ her own threshold, to
which she wishes to attract him, the
threshold being, as Heyne remarks, a
common-place in Latin poetry in con-
nexion with lovers' visits3 .there is no
allusion to the practice mentioned by
Theocr. 11 60, of performi incantations
at the door of the person w ose presence
was doeired. ·

94. ‘ Debent’ is explained by ‘pig-
nora.’ They are ‚his pledges‚ and bind
him to redeem them.

96-101. ‘ These poison -plants Ι had from
the great Moeris, who by their help could
transform himself, conjure up spints, and
charm away crops.'

96. ‘ Herbas atque venena‚' hendiadys.

Pontus had a reputation for poisons
from its connexion with Mithridates, and
produced a particular poison-plant, the
aconite. But it may be put here for Col-
chis, the country of Medea, in the [wider
sense of the word] which we find in Cic.
Pro Lege Man. 9, Juv. x1v 114, cited by
F orb. [and in Ovid.]

97. ⁶ Moeris’ is mentioned nowhere
else 3 but his name is given to a she herd
in the next Eclogue‚ and he is oubt-
less meant to be a noted country wizard.

‘ Plurima’ is closely connected with
‘ nascuntur. ’

98. The change of men into wolves,
λυκανθρωπία, was a common superstition,
lasting into and beyond the Middle Ages.
The story of Lycaon, Ov. M. 1 209 soll„
is εἱῗὶεῑηὶηξξέεἳοε os the earlier traditions
on e su .

‘ Et se cJondere silvis ' goes closely with
‘lupum fieri‚' ‘his ’ belonging to the one
clause only in its connexion with the other.
In Ov. l. c. Lycaon ‘nactus silentia rutis
exululat.' So in vl 80, Tereus or Philo-
mela¹ immediately on being transformed,
flies to the desert. ι
