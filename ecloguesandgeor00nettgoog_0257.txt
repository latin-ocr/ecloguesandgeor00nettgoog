INTRODUCTI ΟΝ. 149

potable poisons and their remedies ; each consists of a number of
paragraphs of moderate length, apparently bearing a substantial
resemblance to one another, connected by modes of transition
which are not quite free from sameneSS, and occasionally relieved
by some mythological or geographical notice ; and each ends
with a brief reference to the author, whom the person addressed
is requested to bear in mind. In the Theriaca there are one or
two passages which enable us to compare Nicander more closely
with Virgil. The directions in the Third Book of the Georgics
to get rid of serpents from the cattle-sheds by fumigation are to
be found at the opening of Nicander’s poem. Later in the poem
occur a few lines on the ChersydrOS, which have supplied Virgil · ,ια’ ι 2 ·
with the details of his picture of the baleful serpent which haunts ’
the mountain lawns of Calabria. Every reader of the Georgics
will recognize¹ the monster that at first under the wide-throated
lake wages truceless war with the frogS, but when Seirius dries
up the water, and the dregs at the bottom of the lake are seen,
appears that moment on land, adust and bloodleSS, warming his
grim form in the sun, and hissingly with out-darted tongue makes
a thirsty furrow as he goes,

The mention of these metaphrastae may perhaps indicate the
right point of view from which to regard Virgil's own work.
Their characteristic was that they furnished metre and language
to matter which had been collected by others ; and any one who
will read the Georgics, verifying the references made by the com·
mentators, such as Heyne, to the prose writers on agriculture,
will probably agree that this is substantially what Virgil has
done. If he differs from them, it is that he passes from writer to
writer, the extent of his subject suggesting that variety which his

Nicander there is room for considerable differences of opinion ι but 1 have endeavoured
to render closely, so as to give some notion os his style.
