xc THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

in whggg writingS, as we have seen, a great deal os lexicographical work
is em ded. >

The name of Terentius Scaurus, the author of a Latin grammar and a
controversial treatise against Caesellius Vindex, as well as of com-
mentaries on Plautus and Virgil, brings us into the reign of Hadrian.
Gellius calls him (xr xv 3) ‘ divi Hadriani temporibus grammaticus vel
nobilissimus.’ His grammatical works are cited by Gellius and the
later grammarians: of his commentary on Virgil so little is expressly
quoted that it would be rash to pronounce any judgment upon its
merits. In A. 111 484, ‘nec cedit honori,' Servius tells us that Scaurus
read ‘ honore! The Verona scholia quote a note os his on Crete ιν 146,
and another on v 95, in which a theory is advocated that snakes are born
from the marrow of men ε a notion which also appears in Servius' note on
the passage.

The Carthaginian Sulpicius ApollinariS, the master of Aulus Gellius
as well' as os the unfortunate emperor Pertinax, paid considerable
attention to Virgil. A note of his on ‘ Silvius Albanum nomen, tua
postuma proleS‚' ete„ in which he controverted the opinion of Caesellius
Vindex, is mentioned by Gellius, 11 xvi 8. Gellius, vu xvi 12, says that
he took ‘praepetes aves ' as equivalent to Homer's οἰωνοί τανυπτέρυγεςι
and xvl v 4 foll. quotes his opinion on the prefix ve in vemens, vescus,
vestibulum. As far as vescus is concerned, Sulpicius seems merely to
have quoted the opinion os Verrius Flaccus (see above p. lvi), as indeed
he also did in the case os the word postumus (comp. Festus, p. 238).

1 2. POLLIO.

A scholar of this name with the nomen Asinius is mentioned by
Servius on Aen. 11 7 and elsewhere several timeS. The remarks
attributed to him are foolish and hardly worth quoting. On the passage
just alluded to, for instance, he seems to have observed that ‘ duri miles
Ulixi ' was meant for Achaemenides It is possible, os course, that
the celebrated Asinius Pollio may have criticised Virgil, but that such
notes can have come from him, or from any scholar of the Augustan
age, is almost incredible, and Ι am therefore inclined to agree with
Ribbeck (Prol. p. 116) that if the Pollio os Servius is to be identified
with any known person, he was probably the scholar mentioned twice
by Marcus Aurelius (Fronto, pp. 42, 63, Naber) as an excellent
commentator on Horace.

13. IULIUS HATERIANUS.

Haterianus is mentioned as a commentator on Virgil by Macrobius
(111 viii 2), and several times in the Verona scholia. He is assumed by
the historians of Latin literature to be the Haterianus who is quoted as
an authority by Trebellius Pollio in his history of the thirty tyrants
(Script. Hist. Aug. XXX Tyr. vr 5), in which case he must belong to the
last part of the third century Λα).
