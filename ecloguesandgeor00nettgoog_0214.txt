106 P. VERGILI MARONIS

ECLOGA IX. [MOERIS]

LYCIDAS. MOERIS.

Tun historical occasion of this Eclogue has been already noticed in the Introduction
to E. 1. According to the traditional account, virgil, after obtaining a promise os
protection, returned to his property, but he found his entrance resisted and his lise
menaced by an intruding soldier, whose name is variously given as Arrius, Clodius,
or Milienus Toro ; he then fled, and made a second appeal to the higher authoritieS,
which was crowned with more permanent success, Ruaeus conjectures that the pre-
sent Eclogue was in fact a poetical petition presented to Varus or Octavianus. [It is
possible, however, as is argued in an excursus at the end of this Eclogue, that the
traditional account is untrue, and that this poem is earlier than the first Eclogue.]

whatever its exact occasion, it is skilfully contrived to interest the reader in the
poet’s favour. Moeris, one of the servants, is going to the town, doubtless Mantua,
with part of the farm produce, which he is to give to the usurping proprietor, when he
is stopped by a neighbour, Lycidas, relates his and his master's troubles, and receives
a warm expression of sympathy at a loss which had so nearly fallen on the whole dis·
trict by the death of their illustrious compatriot. Some os the poet’s verses are quoted
by way of showing how great that loss would have been, while Virg.’s successful return
is hinted at as an event which will produce further poems, There is a compliment to
Varus (v. 27), and another to Caesar (v. 46).

The framework is more or less borrowed from the Θαλύσια of Theocritus (Idyl vu),
the most personal of that poet's works, the first part of which is taken up by an account
of a country walk, in the course of which LycidaS, a goatherd and a famous singer,
comes up with Simichidas, the representative of TheocrituS, and consents to sing with
him as they journey along. Some passages in the Eclogue are modelled on passages
from other Idyls which are referred to in the noteS.

As there are no hills or beeches in the Mantuan territory, which, if any, must be
referred to vv. 7 soll„ the scenery seems to be imaginary or confused, a conclusion
confirmed by v. 57. (See note at the end os the Eclogues, p. 125.)

The correspondence between the specimens quoted from Menalcas' poetry, Lycidas
and Moeris first repeating three, then five lines each, is doubtless intentional. See the
last paragraph of the Introduction to the Eclogues (pp. 20·21).

The date of the poem is perhaps later than that of Eclogue v (see v. 19), and con-
sequently than those of Eclogues 11 and 111.
