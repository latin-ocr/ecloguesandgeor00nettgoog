certum est in silvis inter spelea ferarum

malle pati tenerisque meos incidere amores
arboribus; crescent illae, cresceti8‚ amores

interea mixtis lustrabo Maenala N ymphiS, 55
aut acris venabor apros; non me ulla vetabunt
frigora Parthenios canibus circumdare saltus;

iam mihi per rupes videor lucosque sonantis

ire; libet Partho torquere Cydonia cornu

spicula. tamquam haec sit nostri medicina furoris,
aut deus ille malis hominum mitescere discat! 61
iarn neque Amadryades rursus nec carmina nobis

52. ‘Spelea,⁸ σπήλαια, Ciris, 466: it
seems not to occur again tiu Claudian (B.
εει. v. 354), who doubtless copied

irgil.

Posse pati,’ Lucan v 313, ‘ Et nescis sine
rege pati,’ Id. lx 262, quoted by Emm—
as ‘wgtzygs‘ffzgz-it grangia llige-s it as the
title of his poems. It may have been the
title of Gallus' elegies ; the words of Serv.
(v. ι) are ‘ amorum suorum de Cytheride
libros scripsit quattuor.' With the whole

54. Heyne comp. Ov. Her. v 23, ‘ Et
quantum trunci, tantum mea nomina cres-
cunt: Crescite, et in titulos surgite 'recta
meos.‘ Perhaps Virg. may mean, as Voss
thinks, not merely that the verses will
grow with the tree, but that the passion
will increase.

55. He will throw himself into the
hunting part of a shepherd's life (11 29
note). ‘ Mixtis Nymphis‚’ a common
{535³ {3¹ ‘xmsss‘iss'’ TLYffy‘ffiuffs ἰὲῗῖιξὲ
wood' and mountain would e part in
the chase, as when they attend on Diana,
Od. vr 10 .

‘ Lustraie ’ need not refer s ‘ lly to
dancing, as Voss thinks, thoug that may
have been the motion in the chase (comp.
A. 1 499). With the passage generally
comp. G. 111 40 foll.

56. ‘ Aut ’ merely distinguishae the
actual chase from its preliminaries. So
A. 1 322, ‘errantem . . succinctam . . .
aut spumantis apri cursum clamore pre·
mentem.’

57. ‘ Parthenios ¹ agrees with the Ar-
cadian scenery. ‘ Canibus circumdare
saltus,' G. 1 140. See on νῐ 56.

58. ‘ Lucosque sonantis‚'¹ with the cry
of the hunt (G. 111 43). The words
recur G. lv 364, where the noise is that
of water. ⁸

59. ‘ Partho ‘ and ‘ Cydonia ’ (ι Gnosia
spicula,’ A. v 306, the Cretan reeds being
especially good for arrows) are probably
literary epithets (note on 1 54).

‘ Cornu ’ for a bow os horn, A. vu 497.
See the description of Pandarus’ bow. Il.
1v 105 soll.

‘ T orquere, ² improperly used ofshooting
an arrow, as in A. v 497. ,

60. In the full burst of enthusiasm he
feels be is deluding himself (Heyne).

‘ Sint ’ was adopted by He e after
Heius. from Med. ς Wagn. just y regards
thisas a case of the confusion of numberS‚
common even in the best MSS. (see on
vl 30), ‘haec’ having been wrongly su -
posed to refer to ‘spicula.’ [See also Ri ·
beck, Prolegomena‚ p. 207.]

61. ‘ Ille, whom we know so well—
too well to think him capable of pity. So
‘ illum,' v. 64.

62-69. ‘ No, woodland and song are
delusions after all ; love is not to be
baffled by the most violent change of
scene—we bave only to give way. ’

62. ‘ Iam ’ expresses that the chauge of
feeling is already begun.

‘ Amadryades,' the nymphs of v. 55.

‘ Rursus ’ is restored by Wagn. here
and in 63 from Pal„ Rom. and Med. corr.
with the remark that in the best MSS.
‘ rursum ’ is generally found only before a
vowel. [Ribbeck following Med. pr. m.
has ‘ rusum' here, ‘ rursus’ in 63.]
