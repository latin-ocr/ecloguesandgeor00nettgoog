praecipuum iarn inde a teneris inpende laborem.

continuo pecoris generosi pullus in arvis

altius ingreditur, et mollia crura reponit;

luxuriatque toris animosum pectus, honesti
spadices glaucique, color deterrimus albis
et gilv0. tum, si qua sonum procul arma dedere,

74. ‘ A teneris,' from soah, like ‘ a
pueris,’ from boyhood.

75. ‘Continuo‚’fromthefirst: 1 169, 356.

76. ‘Altius in editur' seems to mean
‘steps higher.' arro (11 7) sayS‚ ‘cruri-
bus rectis et aequalibu5.’ Col. (vt 29),
‘ ae ualibus atque altis rectisque cruribus. ’

‘ ollia crura reponit:’ Serv. quotes
from Ennius, who is speaking of cranes,
⁸ Perque fabam repunt et mollia crura re-
ponunt.² ‘ Mollia,’ flexible: Lucr. lv
789, 980, ‘ mollia membra moventis '

‘ Reponit : ' the meaning is doubtful.
Trapp hints that the ‘re’ denotes alter-
nation, a sense which we may perhaps

arallel by ὁπλαῖς ἀμειβόμενοι, Pind.

th. lv 226. Ke' htle takes the ‘ re ' to
mean frequeney‚—¹÷ays gast to the ground.
But it is more probably to be explained
as correlative to ‘ altius ingreditur.’ ‘ See
how high he steps in the pasture, and
with what‘spring he brings down his legs.'

of a colt’s courage is given by Col. vl 2,
and Varro 11 7. The bridges meant were
probably wooden. Comp. Pliny vul 169
(speaking of asses) ‘ nec pontes transeunt
per raritatem eorum tralucentibus fluviis!

Pal. has ‘minantiS,’ supported by Sen.
Ep. 95, and Ribbeck adopts it.

· Gu‘d. and, the first reading of Med.
gwss‘b. 13oxi-(gistum ε’ this word seems, when
{332⁶ “fieiffm’ctssmmeff¹¹ ‘⁶t¹3²¹‹}{1{¹.⁶3
Catul’l. vam 72. ‘firguffl eaput’ i’s
ptr-obably the opposite to ‘turpe caput.’

arro and Col. recommend a small head3
and this smallness is implied in ⁸ argutus‚’
as largeness is in ‘ turpi5.’

&⁹⁴1

‘ Obesus ' is opposed to ‘ gracilis.’

81. ‘Animosum,'spirited, because mus-
cular. ⁶ Honesti,' from the context, means
‘ good ' rather than ‘ handsome.’

82. ‘Spadices,’ bay; as appears from
Gen. 11 26, who derives it from σπάδιξ,
the Doric sor a palm, and says that the
colour is that of a not too ripe date.
[‘ Nam poeniceuS, quem tu Graece φοίνικα
dixisti, noster est et rutilus et spadix) So
Serv. and the Berne scholia.—H. N.]
A synonym for the word is ‘ badius ’ or
‘ baidius,' βαΐδιος, from βαίς, also a palm
bmnch, whence the Italian ‘ bai0, our
‘ba . .
‘ {ilauciss blue grey (Keightley). [Gen.
11 26 says that Virg. might equally well
have used ‘caerulus.'—H. N.]

‘ Albis :’ Keightley says this remark
must be confined to stallions. The dis·
tinction taken between ‘ albus ' and ‘ can·
didus‚’ as is the praise of white horses in
the classics was confined to the latter, is
overthrown by Hor. S. 1 vii 8, ‘equis
praecurreret albis, ' Serv. mentions astrange
notion [found in Philar . and the Berne
scholia, which here evi ently depend on
Philarg.] ⁶ Multi ita legunt albis et gilvo,
ut non album vel ilvum sed albogilvum
vituperet; quod fa um est.’

83. ⁸ Gilvo,’ dun (Keightley). ‘ Si qua'
for ‘ si forte‚’ like ‘si quem ’ for ‘sicubi,’
A. 1 181, and the common use of ‘ nullus’
for ‘ non’ (E. x 12).

84. ‘Mieat auribu5‚’ he pricks up his
earS. Comp. the phrase ‘ micare digitis.’
The instrum. abl. ‘auribus' denotes an
action, whereas the accusative ‘ artus ’ de-
notes an affection, though the distinction
does not hold universally. ‘ Tremit artuS,’
from Lucr. 111 489.
