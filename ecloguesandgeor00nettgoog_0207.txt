53-57. ‘ Let the order of nature be
reversed, barren things becoming fruitsul,
and base thiu honourable.'

53. He ha before prophesied unequal
and unnatural unionS, vv. 27, 28: he now
prays that, as he is to die despairing and
a meaner man to triumph, a similar
change may 'affect all nature. The changes
which he desires are those which are
mentioned elsewhere as the results of the
golden age (111 89, ιν 30, etc„ v 60), the
- same events being capable of being re-
garded either as a bestowal os favour on
the less favoured
transference os the just rights of the strong
and beautiful to the weak and contemp-
tible. Thus the prayer os v. 56 may be

aralleled with Horace's address to the

use (Od. ιν iii 19), ‘O mutis quoque
piscibus Donatura cycni, si libeat, sonum,’
and the change of Tityrus into Orpheus
with the shepherd· t’s boast (lv 55 foll. )‚
that he will equ Orpheus and Linus if
allowed to sing in the golden age. In

dishonour done to Daphnis.

‘ Ultro,’ not only sorbeat to molest
them, but actually fly from them in his

55. The tamarisk, as in tv 2, vl 10,
seems to be chosen as one of the meaner
plants, which is supposed to be raised to
the privileges of the alder or ffipm’ the
river-trees (vl 63) which were lieved to

56. ‘ Certent—ululae,’ a proverbial ex-
ression, which appears in various forms,
hegcsg. 13:366, v 136, 1373 Lucr. 111 6:

and she may delight m it.'

59. Ribbeck [and Conington] accept
‘fiat' from Med„ Pal„ SerV. for ‘fiant '
[Gud.‚ etc„ Priscian, Donatus]. The sense
is os course the same either way. κ

‘ Medium,' the mid or deep sea. ‘ Gra· ⁸
ditur't'que per aequor Iam medium,' A. 111
665. The wish, as Elmsley pointed out,
appears to be a mistranslation‘ of Theocr.
1 134, πάντα δ’ ἔναλλα γένοιτο, as if the
word were ἐνάλια. Virg. may have in·
tended to lead up to this thought by the
mention of Tityrus in the sea, v. 57, ‘in
short, let earth take the place of sea.' So
the farewell to the woods, ‘ silvae' con-
trasted with the sea, as in v. 57, and the
shepherd’s resolution to drown himself,
are introduced as if in anticipation of this
general change. The notion cannot be
called appropriate, though we are pre·
pared for lt by such passages as 1 60, and
that uoted from Hdt. in the note there.
The arewell is from Theocr. 1 1 15, where
it is given in much greater detail. ‘ Con-
cedite silvae‚’ x 63.

σκοπιάσδεται suggested ‘ specula ' here,
though the word, like the Homeric
σεοπιὴ, evidently means no more than a
mountain-top which may be used as a
watch-tower. ‘Specula ab alta,’ A. x
454 The Ciris hasa similar line, ν. 301.
