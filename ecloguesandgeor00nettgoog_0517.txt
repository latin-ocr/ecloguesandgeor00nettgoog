DIDACTIC POETS OF ROME. 409

cased animals and their keepers are anointed with oil from a natural
spring in a cavern sacred to Vulcan‚ and a companion picture of a yearly
lustration of hounds and hunting implements in the grove of the Arician
Diana. The remainder of the poem, only 40 lineS, is occupied with
an enumeration of the best breeds of horseS‚ the preference being appa·
rently given to the Italian,² in a passage which in its completed form
may have been intended, as Wernsdorf thinks, as the actual conclusion
of the work, though both symmetry of composition and the claims of
the subJ'ect might certainly have pleaded for a more extended treatment.

The following passage, on the early training of the metagon‚ will, I
think, give a sair notion of Grattius, both in his strength and in his
weakneSS. The early part contains nice observatiom pleasingly expressed,
though the language sometimes sails in perspicuity3 the latter shows how
easily he can fall into tasteless common-place.

‘ Tum deinde moneb0,
ne matrem indocilis natorum turba fatiget,
percensere notis», iamque inde excernere parvos.
signa dabunt ipsi. teneris vix artubus haeret
ille tuos olim non defecturus honores:
iamque illum impatiens aequae vementia sortis
extulit: adfectat materna regna sub alvu,
ubera tota tenet, a tergo liber aperto‚²
dum tepida indulget terris clementia mundi.
verum ubi Caurino perstrinxit frigore vesper,
ira iacet, turbaque potens operitur inerti.
illius et manibus viris sit cura futuras
perpensare z levis deducet pondere fratres.
nec me pignoribus»,³ nec te mea earmina fallent.
protinus et cultus alios et debita fetae
blandimenta sereS, curaque sequere merentem:
illa perinde suos ut erit delacta minores,⁴

¹ The sense however of the lines in which the Italian breed is mentioned, the last
three of the poem, is very doubtful, as several words have been obliterated⁴

² Burmann conjectures ‘ Ubera tota tenens, ac tergo liber aperto) Gronovius
changes ‘a’ (which seems to be merely a correction of the MS, reading ‘ea’) into
⁶ stat ς ’ he is followed by Haupt. The sense is that this promising whelp monopolizes
his mother’s teat, and will not let any of his brothers get on his back, except in cold
weather‚ when he is more tolerant.

³ 1f the text is right, ‘ pignoribus ’ must have the sense of ‘ indiciis) ⁸ Yon will
not find the tokens mentioned in my poem delusive, any more than 1 do.’ But Bur·
mann is probably right in reading ‘ Haec de pignoribus (nec te mea carmina fallent) :
Protinus,’ etc„ the young. ‘ pignora’ being distinguished from the mother.

⁴ For these words, which of course give no sense, Johnson, an English editor of
Grattius and Nemesianus (London, 1699), ingeniously suggests ‘suo nutrit,' or ⁸ sa-
turat,' ⁸ de lacte minores) Lachmann, whom Haupt follows, changes ‘ delacta ' into
⁸ devincta,' the MS. reading in the next line being not ⁸ ac ' but ‘ ad.’
