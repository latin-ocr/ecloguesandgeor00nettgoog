ON
THE LATER BUCOLIC POETS OF ROME,

ESPECIALLY CALPURNIUS AND NEMESIANUS.

Ir bucolic poetry found no cultivators at Rome before the time of
Virgil, it does not seem to have enjoyed much more popularity after-
wardS. Wernsdorf (Poetae Latini MinoreS, vol. ii, praef. pp. vi, vii),
who wonders that it should not have flourished more among a people
originally sprung from shepherds and preserving the recollection of their
origin by annual festivals, and inclines to lay the blame on the luxurious
temper of the great city, as being naturally antagonistic to a taste for
rustic simplicity, is sufficiently explicit in his testimony to the fact,
stating that no trace can be discovered of the existence of any bucolic
writer after Virgil earlier than Calpurnius, while the pastoral poets of a
later period, with the exception of NemesianuS, who, in his view, as we
shall see, is not really one of thern, are inelegant and hardly worth
reprinting. Calpurnius and Nemesianus themselves cannot be said to
stand high in the list of post-Augustan authors; but as they happen to
fall within the classical period, as commonly understood, and conform
more closely than their successors to the Theocritean or Virgilian type,
perhaps a brief account of them may not be unacceptable.

At the outset we are met by a critical question, affecting the author-
ship of the works which bear their name. These amount jointly to
eleven pastorals, most of thern averaging less than one hundred lineS.
All of them were assigned by the five first editionS, following the
majority of the MSS„ to a single writer, T. (or, as the first edition gives
it, after one MS„ C.) Calpurnius Siculus. The sixth edition, ‘impressum
Parmae per Angelfi Ugolett’i‚’ without a date, but referred by Ulitius to
the year 1500, made a division of the authorship, attributing the seven
first pastorals to CalpurniuS, the remaining four to [M. Aurelius Olympius]
NemesianuS, on the authority of a ‘ most ancient and correct ' MS. from
Germany belonging to Thadaeus UgoletuS. It also prefixed a title to
the bucolics of CalpurniuS, inscribing them to this same Nemesianus,
This arrangement seems to have been followed almost unhesitatingly by
subsequent editors till the time of Janus Ulitius, who, in his Venatio
Novantiqua (Elzevir, 1645, an edition of the didactic writers on hunting,
