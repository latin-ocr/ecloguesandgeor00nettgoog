nanced by the resent practice at Soiacca
in Sicily. ‘ hen the land is manured,
which is rarely the case, it yields corn
every year, otherwise once in three years:
thuS, first year corn (fromento); second
ear fallow, and the weeds mowed sor

treat of loughing, and direct at what
seasons t ⁸ operation should be per-
formed, they have the sallow·land only in
view. The seasons of ploughing . . were
ln the spring and summer, while the crop
was on the ground ; for the seed-time was
in autumn, and the harvest in the end os
summer. The directions given must there·
sore relate only to the fallow. 1t would
seem that they considered the ploughings
given to land that had carried a crop the
geneding year, and was immediately to
sown for another, as of so little con-
sequence that it was needless to give any
directions about them. From this we may
conclude that they considered ploughing
and sowing immediately after a crop as
bad husbandry, and only to be practised
in a case of necessity; or at least that
they were of opinion that very little of
their land was so rich as to allow this
kind of management) Com are Dau-
beny's Lectures p. 125, [P in. xvm
ι3“7]Ᾱ112111ἰ5,’ alternately, implying no
more than that the husbandman instead
of sowing every time is to sow every
other time.

hysical effect of exposure to the air.

Recent writers on philology, Stolz, de

words denoting decay.]

73. ‘ Mutato sidere z ⁹ wheat would not
be sown at the same season as pulse. See
vv. 215, 220. ⁸ Sidere’ is used strictly,
as in v. 1, for the seasons of the year were
marked b the constellations. Keightley
seems rig t (aster Voss) in supposing these
two crops to be sown in the same year,
the pulse in spring, the wheat in autumn.
Rom. has ‘semine.’
