xxvi LIFE OF VIRGIL.

‘ Cedite Romani scriptores, cedite Grai,
Nescio quid maius nascitur Iliade,'

which show that he was one of the friends who were admitted by Virgil
to listen and criticise.¹ 1 have elsewhere ² endeavoured to collect other
evidence os this fact drawn from coincidences of language between Pro-
pertius and Virgil.

In 26 and 25 B.C. Augustus was absent in Spain, and wrote to Virgil
pressing him to send him either his first sketch of the Aeneid, or any
paragraph or passage he pleased.⁸ Virgil refused‚⁴ urging that he had
as yet nothing sufficiently finished, and dwelling on the vastness of the
material, and the new studies that he was about to give to the subject.
The second, fourth, and sixth books were, however, at length read to
Augustus and Octavia. This must have been after the death of the
young Marcellus in 23 B.c. When Virgil came to the famous passage,
‘ Tu Marcellus eriS,' Octavia is said to have fallen into a long swoon.⁸

The events os 19 ac. are alluded to in the sixth and seventh books
(v1 794, vn 606), which shows that Virgil was still busy with this part of
the Aeneid till within a short time of his death. Ribbeck supposes that
he was also engaged in the latter years of his life upon a fresh edition of
the Georgics. However this may be, there seems no reason to doubt
that the end of the fourth Georgic was altered in or after the year 26,
when the poet Gallus came to his tragica] and untimely end. The
original conclusion of the book, which in some way or other had been
intended by Virgil as a compliment to Gallus, νας, at the instance of
Augustus, cut out, and the episode of Aristaeus substituted for it.⁶

Asia Minor, with the view of spending three years there in finishing and

ambigebat, quo magis iudicium hominum experiretur.'

that Virgil copied Propertius in the Aeneid, while Propertius copied the Georgics and
Eclogues.]
