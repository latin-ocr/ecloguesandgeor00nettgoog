158 GEORGICA.

ing no scope for the pains of pity or of envy, seems to show a
lingering sympathy with philosophie doctrine even after he had
resigned himself to an unphilosophic life. Nor is this the only
passage in which we find traces of a yearning after philosophy as
the true sphere of a poet. The song of Iopas in the First Book
of the Aeneid, where several lines are repeated from the passage
we have just been considering, shows that the conception was
one which continued to dwell with him through life : the song of
Silenus in the sixth Eclogue is a witness no less to its early
formation. In the latter, as we there saw, a cosmogony which,
though not strictly Epicurean, is expressed throughout in Lucre-
tian phraseology, is succeeded bya series of mythological storieS,
as in Ovid’s Metamorphoses: but the compromise is merely⁸
equivalent to the oscillation of mind shown in the Georgics,
between the scientific temper that defies death by disbelieving
the future and the primitive saith in wood-gods and nymphs,
The same feeling shows itself in the scattered hints of a pessimist
spirit which appear even on trifling occasionS, in the reflection on
the unequal struggle between man and nature as exemplified in
the sowing of pulse, and the exhortation to the breeder of cattle
to take advantage of those bright days of life which are the first
to fly. The general impression which we thus gain is singularly
confirmed by Virgil’s biographer, who tells uS, with every appear-
ance os truth, that just before his last illness he had resolved to
spend three years abroad in polishing the Aeneid, and then, for
the rest of his life, to devote himself to philosophy. Such a taste
is of course not in itself inconsistent with a love of the external
aspects of nature3 but it shows that, in his judgment at least,
natural beauty was not his one congenial clement, the only
atmosphere which could invigorate the pulses and sustain the
wings of his fancy. His philosophical aspirations are those of an
intellectual amateur rather than of a genuine lover of wisdom :
but the temperament which admits of such lukewarm devo·
tion is one which we should expect to find not in the single·
minded enthusiast for nature, but in the many-sided cultivator
of art.

The Georgics have been characterized by Mr. Merivale as the
Glorification of Labour. Such epigrammatic judgments are,
