3²· Caesar is invited to take his place
among the ‘ s of the Zodiac, which
were identifi with living beings.

‘ Tardis ’ is generally explained of the
summer months, after Manil. 11 102, ‘ cum
sol adversa per astra Aestivum tardis at·
tollit mensibus annum) But it need be
only a disparaging epithet, intended to
exalt the power of Caesar, who is to speed
the year, as Cowley (DavideiS, Book 1)
says, ⁸ The old drudging Sun from his
tongssbeaten way Shall at thy voice· stan,
and misguide the day.'

33. ‘ ChelaS‚' χηλάς, the claws of the
scorpion (Arat. 81, μεγάλας ἐπιμαίεο χη-
λάς), which in early representations of the
zodiac occupied the place of a separate
sign. So Ov. Μ. 11 195, ‘ Est locus, in
geminos ubi bracchia concavat arcus
Scorpios, et cauda flexisque utrimque
lacertis Porrigit in s atium signorum
membra duorum.’ en the Balance
was introduced, it was sometimes placed
in the Scorpion's clawS, as in a sculpture
referred to by Heyne. Augustus' birth is
l said to have taken place under Libra,
* zssff‘ffi {512}th ‘ziffffiozi'ffiffiffifss‘iff
tended to the justice of his government.

‘ Sequentis‚’ next in order.

34. ⁸ Ipse . . . . reli uit‚’parenthetical.
The scorpion retires of ‘mself, so that the
place is in fact ready for Caesar.

‘ArdenS‚’ as a star, and also as a
poisonous creature.

35. ‘Reliquit' (Mem, Rom.‚ Gud.)
is more forcible than ‘ relinquit ’ (Pal. and
two of Ribbeck’s cursivoe), expressing
further the scorpion’s alacrity. Comp. the
note on v. 49 below.

‘Iusta plus parte ι ’ having formerly
taken more than his share, now he is con-
tent with less. ·

36. ‘Sperant ' (Med., Rom„ Pal.) was
Piffiyhffissfiffi ἳζοῖιᾚέ affirm ¹55
hope3 and you cannot be so desirous os
empire on any terms as to wish to be king
there.’ ⁶ sperent ’ (Pal. corr„ Med. corr.)
would create a tautology with the next
line. For ‘ nec ’ Med. Qfirst reading) has
‘ ne. ’

³7· ‘ Tam dira eupido‚’ A. vi 373, lx
185, which show that ‘ dira ' merely means
intense. The line was not improbably
the original of Milton’s‚ ‘ To reign is
worth ambition, though in hell.'

38, 39. ‘ Though the Greeks paint
glowing pictures of Elysium, and Prosper·

pme shows a preference for. the world .

below over the world above.’

4ο. ‘ Vouchsase me a smooth course,
and smile on my bold endeavours, and in
pity, like mine, sor the countryman as he
wanders blind and unguided, assume the
god, and attune thine ear betimes to the
voice of prayer.' The sentence begun
v. 24 is here completed.

‘ Da facilem cursum,’ a metaphor from
sailing (⁶ cursum dare,' A. 111 337). Comp.
11 39, where Maecenas is asked to become
the companion of the voyage, as Caesar
here to be itspatron. So ovid (F. 1 3,
quoted by Cerda) to GermanicuS‚ ⁸ timidae
dirige navis iter-⁹

‘ Audacibus,' like ‘ sanctos ausus reclu-
dere sontis,' 11 175. Keightley.

41. The ignorance os the husbandmen
is involved in the poet's undertaking to
enlighten them. If we believe Virg. to
have found a special motive for writing
his poem in the depressed state of Roman
agriculture, there is an allusion to it here.
⁸ Viae‚’ perhaps with reference to the
metaphor of the preceding line. ‘ Mecum ’
with ‘ miseratus.’
