P. VERGILI MARONIS

nam duo sunt genera, hic melior, insignis et ore
et rutilis clarus squamis, ille horridus alter

namque aliae turpes horrent, ceu pulvere ab alto

will be found when there has been a
battle. This ees substantially with
Varro 111 xvi ffir‘praeterea ut animad-
vertat, ne reguli plures existant ; inutiles
enim fiunt propter seditiones. Et quidam

scribit, du0‚ n' er et varius, qui ita melior,
ut expediat me lari0‚ cum duo sint eadem

rege, esse seditiosum et corrumpere alvum,

ordinary brown bee and the brighter
coloured Liguriam]

‘ Insignis et ore ' seems to refer to mien,
as distinguished from colour. [‘ Que ' is
added as a late corr. in Med. aster
‘ melior.'—H. N. Comp. v. 137.]

93. ‘ Rutilis squamis ’ = ‘ maculis auro
sqssaill‘lgqlltlaalterss 11 397, where however
‘hic' has not preceded. In introducing
the pleonasm here, Virg. may have meant
to point not only to the previous line, but
to the unfinished contrast v. 91.

‘ Horridus desidia ' seems to express
the squalor arising from inaction, its hair
rough, etc. Col. (lx ιο) distinguishes the
better sort as ‘leves ac sine pi10,’ from the
worse, which are ‘ hirsuti' ,

ments; consequently less adapted to lead
the swarm to success (‘ inglorius ’). So
Aristot. (H. A. lx 4) makes the darker
monarch twice the size os the other.
[‘ Alvom ’ Pal. and so Ribbeck.—H. N.]

95. “ Binae ’ seems to be the redicate.

96. ⁶ Horrent ' explained by ‘ orridus,'
v. 93. From the words of Col. l. c. ‘ Nam
deterior sordido sputo similis, tam foedus
quam pulvere . . . viator,’ it would seem

as if he doubted whether the comparison
was to the dusty traveller or to his spittle.
Most commentators take the former view,
but the latter is not impossible, in spite of
the harshness with which the simile would
then be worded. There would then be
some point in ‘ terram spuit,' which other-
gsseqsseems to us a needlessly offensive
etat .

‘Altoz' the dust rising in a column;
‘ pulvere caelum Stare vident,’ A. ΧΠ
φζᾳ ‘Auro et guttis ι’ drops of gold.
See 11 192 note.

in apposition. He seems to have avoided

‘ paribus guttis ' pointedly srom ‘auro.'
For a parallel case of doubtful construc-
tion comp. A. Vl 496 (note).

100. ‘ Caeli tempore,’ like ‘caeli men·
ses ' 1 335, ‘caeli tempore' 111 327. The
seasons are spring and autumn, v. 231.

101. ‘ Premes :’ the honey υνδε run
through wicker-work before being put into
jarS, Col. lx 15, Hor. Epod. 11 153 so
perhaps v. 140 below.

‘ Nec tantum dulcia:’ V' . means to
extol the clearness of honey an its adapta·
bility for mixing with wine (⁸ mulsum,’ 1
344), not to disparage its sweetnaes3 other·
wise he would hardly have called it ‘dulcia'
in the first instance. We shall perhaps be
right in supposing him to hover between two
modes of expression, ‘ nec tantum dulcia,
sed liquida, and ‘ non tam dulcia quam
liquida) This use os ‘ tantum ' sor ⁶ tam ³
with adjectives is not very common.
