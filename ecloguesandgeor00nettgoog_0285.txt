seu pluris calor ille vias et caeca relaxat

seu durat magiS, et venas adstringit hiantis,

Multum adeo, rastris glaebas qui frangit inertes

9ο. ‘Spir menta,'1v 39. So‘spiracula'
Lucr. vl 4 , ‘spiramina' Lucan x 247.
‘ Qua ’ follows ‘viis ’ similarly Α. v 590.

91. The object os ‘durat’ seems to be
the land itself rather than the pore8‚
‘ venas hiantis! The explanations given

92. ‘ TenueS,' subde, penetrating.
‘Tenuisque subibit Halitus,’ 11 349.

‘ Pluviae ⁹ is grammatically constructed
with ‘adurant‚ supplied from ‘adurat,’
which however belongs to it in sense onlyso
sar as it contains the general notion ofinJur·
ing. See on A. 11 780. ‘ Rapidi,' E. 11 10.

93. ‘ Penetrabile :' ‘ enetrale frigu5,’
Lucr. 1 494. [‘ Penetra ilis ' = penetrat-
ing. Ad‘ectives in ⁸ -bilis' are roperly
passive, ut instances occur wit active

Plautus, etc.‚ are dis uted (Munro Lucr.
1 113 Hanssen, Phil'ologus, 1889, 274).
This use of ⁸ penetrabilis recurs A. x 48,
and is imitated by ovid, Maniai, Silius,
etc.

‘ ἐλᾶαι-αῖ ι’ cold is said to burn both by
poets (eg. Ov. M. xlv 763, ⁴ frigus
adurat Poma ’) and by prose writerS, as
Tac. A. xm 35, ‘ ambusti multorum artus
vi frigoris.' Cerda quotes Aristot. Meteor.
Ν 5, eristum-yeme eal θερμαίνειν τὸ ψυχρόν,
οὐχ ὡς τὸ θερμόν, ἀλλὰ τῷ συνάγειν ἣ
‹ivn-ir ἀναι τὸ θερμόν. 50 drosaico-Gai
is used in Theophr. aud the Geoponica.

94-99. ‘ Harrowing is usesul, and so is
&oss-ploughing. ’

94. ‘ Our way, after breaking a field, is
to tear it up with a heavy harrow with
iron teeth, drawn by two or more horsea
The ancients, who were unacquainted
with this harrow . . . used to break the
clods by manual labour with an imple-
ment called a“rastrum,”or a ‘⁶ sarculum :'’

1.

and then, to pulverize it, the men, or per·
haps oxen, drew over it bush-harrows
(crates), nearly the same as now in use‚’
Keightley‚ who explains ‘ rastrum ' to be
a heavy rake, with iton teeth, probably
four in number (Cato x).

⁸ Inertes,' helpless, denotes the state of
the clods when lest to themselveS, not
unlike ⁴ segnem campum‚' v. 72.

95. ⁸ Crate5,' v. 166.

96. ⁸ Flava Ceres,' ‘ rubicunda Ceres,
v. 316, Hom.‘s ξανθὴ Δημήτηρ, the
epithet here seemingly indicating the
nature of the reward.

‘ Neque—nequiquam,’A. v1 117. Ceres
does not regard him vainIy, as if she were
an idle spectator, or unable to help. So
‘respicere ‘ of divine aid E. 1 27. Virg.
may have thought of Hes. Works 299.

97. Virg. means merely to distinguish
the processes of harrowing and cross-
ploughing‚ though he expresses himself
as is both were not carried on by the same
individual, or applied to the same land.
He seems to be enumerating the different
parts of cultivation without regard to
order, forgetting that he has already re-
commended cross-ploughing‚ v. 48. ‘ Pro-
scindere ’ is the technical term sor the first
ploughing, the second being expressed by
‘ offnngere,’ the third by ‘ lirare.'

‘ Suscitat ' is illustrated ‘ inerteS,’ v.
94, and also by ‘suspen ere,' v. 68.
Though in the present tense, it must not
be understood as implying that ploughing
was to be immediately followed by cross-
ploughing‚ as the two took place at
different times 3 it merely denotes the
husbandman's practice. The ‘ clods
which he turns up he afterwards breaks
across! ‘ Terga‚' of the sursace presented
by the clodo, 11 236.
