 

THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lxix

Prisc. 1, p. 561), copulantur, p. 476 (Prisc. 1, p. 393), adiutatur, p. 477
(Prisc. 1, p. 391). The note on augure, p. 469, may have been due to
Pliny, for ServiuS, on A. vu 27 3 quotes a note from Pliny distinguishing
between auguro and auguror.

So sar as these indications g0, they seem to warrant the conclusion to
which the general resemblance between N onius and Priscian has already
pointed. The coincidences between Nonius and Quintilian are important,
as indicating the existence of some work or works on these doubtful verbs
in Quintilian's own time: for Quintilian was not himself a grammarian,
but used the collections of professed scholars when he had to touch on
technical points of this kind. And Quintilian may well have consulted
either Pliny or ProbuS, or both.

In his Prolegomena to Virgil Ribbeck throws out a hint that the whole
of the seventh book of Nonius may, in his opinion, be horrowed from
ProbuS. I feel rather inclined to infer that it is derived, directly or in-
directly, from two sources, This conclusion is, 1 think, warranted by the
fact that even in so short a space the same note several times occurs twice.
This is the case with partit-et, which is illustrated on p. 472 from LuciliuS,
and on p. 475 from Afranius3 with punior, illustrated on p. 471 from
Cicero, and on p. 479 with one of the same passages in a fuller form3
with manduc vr, pp. 477 and 4793 with copulor, pp. 476 and 4793 with
miro, pp. 474 and 4803 with rmmnor, pp. 47 1 and 4803 with moderant,
pp. 471 and 472· , with lucta, pp. 468 and 472. This phenomenon has
already met us in the two lists of Priscian, and it seems natural to
account for it in the same way, viz„ by supposing that there were two
works 1n which the same facts were dealt with and illustrated perhaps to
a great extent by the same exampleS. From these two works the later
grammarians made up their chapters on nouns and verbs, without taking
the pains to avoid treating of the same word twice. We know that two
such works can be ascribed to Pliny and ProbuS, and that Priscian drew
largely upon these two authors. The general resemblance between
Priscian' s chapters on doubtful verbs and the seventh book of Nonius
suggests that it was mainly compiled from Pliny and ProbuS. A fragment
of the same lists is preserved by Diomedes, pp. 400-401, who mentions
frustra, patio, moro, demolio, auxilio, populo, and dtgno· . and Keil has
shown that DiomedeS, in his section on the verb, followed Probus· “

The other grammatica] books of Nonius (v111, ιΧ, Χ, and Χι) can
be in like manner traced to Pliny, ProbuS, and Caper, or at least to
scholars of the first or early second century.

The point of this digression will now at length, I hope, be apparent.
If it can be made highly probable that in two long grammatical sections
of his work Nonius was to a large extent, directly or indirectly, indebted
to ProbuS, is it not also highly probable that in cases where his remarks
on Virgil coincide with notes found in the later Commentators, as the
Verona scholia, Servius, PhilargyriuS, and the Berne scholia, the agree-
ment is to be explained by a similar hypothesis? It is impossible to
suppose that the later Virgilian commentators borrowed from Nonius.
