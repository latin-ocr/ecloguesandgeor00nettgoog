treated much more elaborately. V' urg. has
seized the three main points, dulness as a
s of rain, redness of wind, brightness
o fair weather, and expressed them in
language borrowed from various parts of
his o ' ” l. Aratus has expressed thern
himsel yet more concisely, vv· 70 folla

Πάντα Θουὶρευθομενῃ δοκέειν ἀνέμοιο κελεύ·

Ἀλλοθιθου δ’ ἄλλο μελαινομένῃ δοκέειν υετοῖο.

‘Colligere' seems to imply the recalling
oi things scattered and their formation
into a mass. ‘Revertentes,' returning to
her.' ‘ Sparsosque recolligit ignis,’ Lucan
1 157, of the lightning. The metaphor is

rhaps from a general rallying his forces.
l‘fethis seem too great a strain on the lan·
ἕιιζῇε, w’e may construe ‘colligit’ simply

erS, ’‘and revertentes’‘ reappearing.'
*ἷἮιιιῐ time the mighty moon was gather-
ing light,’ Tennyson.

428. ‘'Aera‚ the air seen between the
horns of the crescent moon. But the words
need only mean ‘if the air is dark and the
crescent dull! [The Berne scholia quote
from Nigidius Figulus De Ventis lib. iv

‘Si summum corniculum maculas nigras
habuerit, in primis mensis partibus imbres
sore3 at si in imo cornu, serenitatem de-
bemus scire. ¹ See also Pliny xv111 347
soll„ and Varro quoted there. -Η, N. ]

429. ‘Agricolis pelagoque,’ a poetical
variety for ‘agris pel agoque' or ‘agricolis

nautisque.'
4.3ο ‘Ore' may be abl. of place [v. 6

above, Roby 1173} But the phrase is
simply an inversion of ‘suffuderit os
rubore,’ and here, as elsewhere (see A. 1
381), Virg„ in secking for variety, seems
to have had more than one possible con·

struction in his mind. It seems scarcely
Virgilian to suppose ‘’ore to be an old
form of the dative.

431. ‘'Vento might be taken either as
an abl. instrum. (see v. 44), or as an abl.
of circumstance (comp. ‘ ut in tectoriis
videmus Aust10‚ ' Cic. de Div. 11 27).1t
might be objected to the latter that the
redness is a prognostic os coming wind,
although we might perhaps say, ‘when
there* is wind about!

432. ‘,’Is ‘ortus quartus.’ Aratus dwells
on the third and fourth as the critical days,
and connects his prognostics with them.
Virg. first gives the unfavourable prognos-
tics without reference to dayS, and then
connects the favourable prognostics with
one of the critical days.

‘Auctor,' authority, A. v 17, ‘non si
mihi Iupiter auctor Spondeat!
ιοῒὲἦηὲἑξζ· ἷῖξῖἒὴῗιξῗὲἑῗ ᾶέῗῗΐέοω

‘obtunsis cornibus’ to παχιῗιν καὶ 'agni'-
βλείῃσι κεραίαις, and‘ rubet’ to ἑρεύθης.

434. Arat. 73 foll. seems to say that
the signs of the third and fourth days will
only hold good sor half the month.

436. ‘Servatiss that have come safe to

rt, not, preserved from peril as if there
ffid been a storm- Comp. σώζεσθαι.

In litore A. v 236. Rom. has a‘d

to Gell.x111 26 (= Macrob. Sat. v 17)
from a line os PartheniuS, -Γλαύιεῳ

εἰναλί ῳ)Μ .The peculiarityisthat
the last syllable of‘ Glauco’ is left open
in the thesis, a licence not indulged m by
Virg. elsewhere.
