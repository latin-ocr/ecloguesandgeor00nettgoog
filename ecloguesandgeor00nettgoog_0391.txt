ante etiarn sceptrum Dictaei regiS, et ante
impia quarn caesis gens est epulata iuvenciS‚
aureus hanc vitam in terris Saturnus agebat:
necdum etiarn audierant inflari classica, necdum
inpositos duris crepitare incudibus enses,

Sed nos immensum spatiis confecimus aequor,
et iam ternpus equum fumantia solvere colla.

Tr. ). We must bear in mind how much

of the third person plural, like the French
the Romans thought of the grandeur of the

⁸ ou,' is common in the Aeneid: e.g. 1

city compared with that of the empire. 638.
[Compare the importance attached to an 540. Med. originally had ‘inpositis
alteration of the ‘ pomerium. ⁹] duros.’

‘ Arce5,' os the hills, v. 172.

536 ‘Dictaei regis -2 Cicero (N D 541, 542. ‘But 1 must end this long

stage of my work-‚⁵

Cretensem, Saturni filium, cuius in illa
insula se ulchrum ostenditur.’

Cerda quotes other instances of the sup·
posed impiety of slaying the ox, the
fellow·labourer of man.

538. ‘Aureus‚' king of the golden age.

541. ‘Spatiis : ’ the plural ‘ spatia,’ as
used by Virg., seems to denote sometimes
the circles of a racecourse, and sometimes
the passage of the racers round them.
Comp. A. v 584, vn 380. We may
therefore either (1) take ‘spatiis’ in the
former sense, and connect it with ‘im-
mensum‚’ as Heyne does, or (2) take it in
the latter, and connect it with ‘confeci-
mus' Heyne resers for a similar meta·

ιππον ἐλάσσω Τέρματος ἀμφιέλισσαι] ἐπι-
ψαύουσαι) ἀοιδὴν. In Lucr. vl 92 soll. the
metaphor is from a scot-tace.

539. ‘ Etiam ’ connects ‘ necdum ’ with
‘ante,' as the former ‘etiam’ connects
‘ ante ’ with what precedes,

EXCURSUS ΟΝ VERSE 81. (EXIIT.)

LACHMANN on Lucr. 111 1042 (pp. 206-210) maintains that the last syllable of ‘iit '
and its compounds and of ⁴ petiit ’ is necessarily long, having been originally written,
as inscriptions prove, with a diphthong. He quotes a number os passages where
‘ rediit,’ ‘ subiit ' etc. are lengthened by Ovid‚ and removes various apparent exceptions
in other authors by corrections more or less supported by MSS.

So sar as the text of Virg. is concerned, his case appears a weak one. Here he would
read ‘exit,’ which is found in no good MS„ though Gud. and the MSS. os Nouius
p. 308 have ‘exilit,’ the authority of the latter being weakened by the fact that
in another place where that author quotes the line, p. 339, his MSS. have ‘exiit' or
‘ exiet.' In A. 11 497 he would read ‘ exit,' from one of Ribbeck’s cursives (marked
‘c’) and the MSS. of Nonius p. 296: in A. v 274 ‘ transit’ from Rom. ε in A. lx
418 ‘it ' from all Ribbeck’s MSS. except Pal. and perhaps Gud. (which Ribbeck
quotes sor both ‘ it ' and ‘iit ’), and from the MSS. os Nonius p. 408, the Montalban ,
