r ‘Avertere, a sanitate mutare,' Serv,

rightly. The phrase is probably a trans·
lation of the Homeric βλάπτειν φρένας
ἐΐσας, Od. xlv 178. She wishes him to be
< ⁸ inlsangsfij pastsionately in love, not cold
s an tn ι eren .

υ 68. ‘ Carmina ' is her magic song, the
same which she has just begun, as the
Furies in Aesch. Eum. 306 call their
choral ode ὕμνος δέσμιος.

69. Imitated from the burden in Theocr.
11 17, etc.‚ ἴυγξ, ἕλκε τὺ τῆνον ἐμὸν ποτὶ
δῶμα τὸν ἄνδρα. ⁶ Ab urbe ' seems to im-
ply that the speaker is a countrywoman
whose lover is away at Mantua, 1 34.

70-73. ‘ Groet is the wer of magic
song ε it ean bring down 3¹2 moon, change
men into bmteS, burst serpents asunder. ’

70. Observe the correspondence of the
3533.ssss Αἷὲἒῗὲἓῖῗῗωέἳξ ἑζὶΐ ἓξὲξ
the subject: the second speaks 0 the
associations connected with the kind os
song chosen. With the resent passage
comp. Tibull. 1 viii 19 011. , which re·
sembles it closely, and A. 1v 487-491.
The power os sorceresses to draw down
the moon is frequently referred to by the
ancients‚ Aristoph. Clouds 749, Hor.
Epod. v 45, xvu 77.

71. See Od. x 203 foll.

7²· For this effect of incantation see
Lucil. Sat. xx 5 (Miiller), ‘ Iam disrum-
petur medius», iam ut Marsu' colubras
Dismmpit cantu, venas cum extenderit
omnes, Ov. M. vn 203, Am. 11 i 25.

‘ Frigidus anguisss 111 93. ‘ Cantando ’
is used substantively or impersonally, like
‘habendo’ G. 11 250, ‘tegendo' G. 111
454, etc·

74-80. ⁴1 twist three threads of dis·
ferent colours round Daphnis' image,

which 1 thriee round the altar, for
the virtue os the number. Let them be
knit into a love-knot.'

74. ⁶ Terna ' probably for ‘ tres,’ though
Serv. supposes that there are nine threads*
of three different colourS, and so the
author of the Ciris, v. 370 foll.. where
this e is imitated.

For the ‘c force os the number
three, comp. heocr. 11 43, A. ιν 511,
Ov. M. v11 189 foll„ Tibull. 1 ii 54,
Hor. Ep. 1 i 36. The three colours, ac-

cording to Serv, ‚ are white, rose-red,
and black.

‘ Tibi ' is explained by ‘ effigiemss v· 75.

‘ Primum,’ as her first effort at incanta·
tion. -

[⁴ Primus ' Pal. originally.—H. N.]

ιὴέῗοξηῗαξᾱῗὸἑῗνέἐἭξεῗῃξὴέἶὶεψᾚὸἷ
would introduce. But Jahn and Forb.
seem right in remarking that ‘ tibi ' is the
keynote os the sentence. ‘ 1 bind these
threadsthrice round thee (thy image), and 1
carry thee in effigy-thrice round this altar.’

76. For the' use of images in love·
charms‚ comp. A. tv 508, Hor. S. 1 viii
30. [Ο. Hirschfeld, De incantamentis et
devinctionibus amatoriis a ud Graecos
Romanosque3 Tylor, Early ist. of Man·
kind, ch. vi.]

‘ Numero deus impare gaudet:'‘ one
superstition, says Serta, was that odd
numbers were immortal, because they
cannot be divided into two equi] partS,
the even being mortal. With the expres·
sion comp. 111 59, ‘amant alterna Ca-
menae. ’ The hemistich recurs in the Ciris,
V· 373·

78. ‘ Twine three colours in three
knots 3' i.e. make three knots, each of a
thread with a different colour.
