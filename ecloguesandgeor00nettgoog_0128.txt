20 BUCOLICA.

first and give, as it were, its tone to the whole ; the exordium os
the tenth Eclogue speaks for itself. Foi· the titles os the various
EclogueS, varying as they do in the different MSS„ the gram-
marians are doubtless to be held responsible. The name Eclogae,
which signifies merely select poem5,¹ in this case the portions of
the Bucolic volume, is to be referred to the same authority.
Some German critiCS, such as Gebauer, in the treatise already
referred t0, and Ribbeck? have supposed themselves to have found
the traces of symmetrical arrangement, amounting to something
like strophical correspondence, throughout the Eclogues That
such a principle was present toVirgil’s mind during the composition
of some of them, the structure of the amoebean part of Eclogues
111, V,V11, and V111 is sufficient to prove: nor does it seem an acci-
dent that the scraps of songs quoted in Eclogue 1x fall into two
pairs of three and five lines respectively; but that is no reason for
seeking symmetry in the Eclogues which are not amoebean, and
torturing the text in order to bring it outf’ It is true that the
sense is more frequently ended with the line in the Eclogues
than in the Georgics or Aeneid‚ so that the appearance of an
imperfect parallelism is sometimes produced ; but without stop-
ping to inquire whether this may be connected with any tradition
of bucolic music, which, though not accepted by Virgil as an
invariable law, may still have influenced him, we may account
for it sufficiently by considering that the hexameter, as handled
by Lucretius and CatulluS, is apt to present the same phenomenon
of unbroken monotony, and that Virgil’s earliest attempts at versi-
fication would naturally be characterized by a greater uniformity
f ¹ See Forcellini s, v. Ecloga. The irrelevancy of the term as applied to pastoral
poetry led Petrarch to a curious emendation, AEglogues, which he accordingly gave as
the title to his own Pastorals; and Spenser‚ among others, followed the example.
Johnson, who remarks (Life of A. Philips) that the word can only mean ‘the talk of
goats,’ not, as it was intended, ‘ the talk of goatherds,’ might have remarked further,
that no such formation could have existed in Greek. The French spelling Egiogms
may be otherwise explained. -

Gliederung, Leipzig, 1882: Mr. Kolster’s theories have met with little acceptance.]
³ Gebauer’s theory obliges him in E. x 32, 33 to put a full stop aster ‘periti‚’
connecting the second ‘ Arcades' with the words that follow, Most readers will, 1
think, feel that the rhythmical beauty of ‘soli cantare periti Arcades’ is worth sar

more, to modern apprehensions at least, than any gain that can be supposed to acerne
from the strophical arrangement of an entire Eclogue.
