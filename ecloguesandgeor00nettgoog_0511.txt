ΟΝ THE LATER' DIDACTIC POETS OF ROME. 403

became almost a matter of course for a Roman poet, and the language
has much of that elaboration and point which after the Augustan age
was exacted as a necessity, while it ceased to be a merit: but there is
no genuine energy or felicity of diction. the expressions are frequently
forced, and the thoughts, where not obviouS, degenerate into conceits:
1 propose to justify this character of a poem which numbers the younger
Scaliger and Bentley among its editorS, and Creech, not the worst
versifier of Dryden's contemporarieS‚ among its translatorS, by a few
extracts frorn the more professedly poetical passageS, and afterwards to
give some notion of the general treatment by an analysis of the F irst
Book.

Each os the five books is introduced by a long exordium, in which
the author was evidently anxious to display his powers as a poet. The
first book has an introduction of 117 lineS‚ the second os at least 59,
the third of 42, the fourth of 121, the fifth of 29: and similar halting-
places are furnished by the conclusions of the first and third books,
In the opening os the second book Manilius elaborates the same
thought which is enforced by Virgil at the beginning of the Third
Georgic, the difficulty of finding a subject which had not been exhausted
by previous treatment: but it is easy to see how far the rhetorician is
removed from the poet. After speaking of Homer in·lines of which the
text is too uncertain to make them worth quoting, he comes to Hesiod.

Hesiodus memorat divos divomque parentis

et Chaos enixum terras», orbemque sub illo
infantem, et primos titubantia sidera partus,
Titanesque senes, Iovis et cunabula magni,
‚et sub fratre viri nomen, sine fratre parentis,
atque iterum patrio nascentem corpore Bacchum,
omniaque immenso volitantia lumina mundo.
quin etiam ruris cultus legesque notavit
militiamque soli, quod colles Bacchus amaret,
quod secunda Ceres campos, quod Pallas utrumque,
atque arbusta vagis essent quod adultera pomiS,
silvarumque deos, sacrataque munia nymphis,
pacis opuS, magnos naturae condit in usus.’

The first remark which occurs-to the mind is on the needless frigidity
of this enumeration of Hesiod's works and their various subjectS‚ when
a line or two, mentioning the poet and indicating the character of his
poetry, would have been quite sufficient: the second is on the equally
gratuitous conceits with which the details are embellished, as in the
lines about the creation, about Jupiter, and about Bacchus,

In entering upon the third book he tells us that he is undertaking a
