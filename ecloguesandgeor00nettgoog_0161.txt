M. Cogite oveS, pueri; si lac praeceperit aestuS,
ut nuper, frustra pressabimus ubera palmis,
D. Heu, heu, quarn pingui macer est mihi taurus in

His certe neque amor causa est; vix ossibus haerent.

nescio quis teneros oculus mihi fascinat agnos
D. Dic, quibus in terris—et eris mihi magnus Apollo—

tris pateat caeli spatium non amplius ulnas,

M. Dic, quibus in terris inscripti nomina regum

98. ‘ Cogite,’ ‘in umbra5,’ which is
expressed in v. 107 of the spurious Culex.
The sheep are driven into the shade at
mid-day that they may be fit for milking
at evcning. Rom. has ‘ aestas.'

99. Observe the reality which ‘ut
nuper ’ gives to the injunction.

100-103. ‘D. My bull won’t fatten:
it is love. Μ. My lambs won’t either:
it is the evil eye.'

100. Theocr. lv 20. ‘Ervum,'a species
of tare: probably the bairy tare that
grows in our fields and hedgeS. Keight·
ley. The old reading before Heins. was
‘ arvo,’ which is found in Rom. ‘ Quam ’
with ‘ macer.'

101. ‘ Exitium est pecori ‘ Rom„ Gud.
corrected, ‘ exitium cori est ’ Gud.
originally, and two of ibbeck's cursives.
A third omits ‘ est’ altogether, which is
the ordinary reading. For a similar doubt
comp. A. v 235.

102. Theocr. lv 15. ‘Mine are not
even so well off as yours3 they have some
malady more mysterious than love.’
‘Neque' is for ‘ne quidem,’ used like
οὐδὲ, a sense found in Livy and ost-
Augustan prose and, probably, in or.
Sat. 11 iii 262. [See exx. in Dr'ager, Hist.
Syntax, ii p. 71.] Madvig ExcurS. 111 on
Cic. De Finibus denies the appropriate·
ness of this sense in the present passage,
and Mr. Munro and others follow him:

describing ill fortune. Their remedy is
to make ‘neque amor causa est' paren·
thetical‚ and either to read ‘hi’ from a con-
jecture of Stephens and Heins., orto treat
⁶ his ’ as an archaism for ‘ hi‚’ which would
be a very hazardous hypothesis in Virg.,

though a passage in Donatus on Ter. Eun.
11 ii 38 is alleged to show that it was so
understood by that critic.

103. Comp. Hor. Ep. 1 xiv 37, ‘Non
istic (at his sarm) obliquo oculo mea com·
moda quisquam Limat, non odio obscuro
morsuque venenat.’

104·107. ‘D. Guess my riddle, and
you shall be my Apollo. M. Guess mine,
and you shall have Phyllis to your-sels)

104. [⁴ Die, et eris :' Cicero in such
cases never inserts ‘et' (Mayor Phil. ii
104) 3 writers after Virg. insert or omit at
will, comp. Hor. Ep. 1xvi 54, xviii 108.]

‘ Apollo ' is the god of divination.

105. According to tradition, Asconius
Pedianus heard Virg. say that he had
intended in this passage to set a trap for
the critics; and that the real answer was
the tomb of Caelius, a Mantuan who had
squandered his estate, and left himself
only land enough sor a tomb. The critics
nia be pardoned if they have fallen into
suc a trap, though their guesses, e.g.
a well, an oven, the shield of Achilles, the
pit called ‘mundus' in the Comitium,
only opened for three days each year, are
not happy. ⁸ Caeli spatium' would not
naturally express the ground possessed by
or covering CaeliuS, so that the riddle,
according to its traditional explanation,
does not even fulfil the conditions of a
good catch. [The Berne scholia quote,
not Asconius, but CornutuS, as the
authority for the story about Virg. Rib-
beck thinks ‘ Cornutus' is corrupt for
‘ CorneliuS,’ i.e. the poet Cornelius
Gallus—H. N.]

For the construction ‘non amplius tris
ulnas,' see G. ιν 207, A. 1 683.

106. ‘Regum,’ rinces3 the Homeric
βασιλῆες. The ower is the hyacinth
