P. VERGILI MARONIS

quamvis multa meis exiret victima saeptiS,
pinguis et ingratae premeretur caseus urbi,
non umquam gravis aere domum mihi dextra

redibat.

M. Mirabar quid maesta deosl Amaryllis vocareS,
cui pendere sua patereris in arbore poma:
Tityrus hinc aberat. ipsae telTityre7 pinuS,
ipsi te sonteS, ipsa haec arbusta vocabant.

T . Quid facerem ? neque servitio me exire licebat,

gests, to the propert which children
might hold with their ather’s leave.

33. Fronto says that ‘ victima ' denotes
the larger beasts, ‘ hostia ’ the smaller.

‘ Saepti5,’ sences or enclosureS. Varro
(R. R. 1 14) ‘De saeptiS‚ quae.tutandi
causa fundi fiunt.' Here it = ‘ ovilibus,'
just as the voting enclosures in the Cam-
pus Martius were called both ‘saepta'
and ‘ ovilia.’

34. ‘Ingratae,’ because it did not pay
him sor his trouble. ‘Animi ingratam
naturam ascere semper,' Lucr. 111 1003.
All that ityrus did in those days seemed
to be thrown away.

‘ Pinguis’ with ‘caseus' not, as some
have thought, with ‘ victima! The less
important thing requires an epithet to
dignisy it. Spohn refers to Colum. vu 8,
from which it would seem that ‘ pinguis ’
would denote a cream cheese as distin-
guished from one made with milk (⁴ tenui
liquore ¹).

35. So the author of the Moretum, v.
83, ‘ Inde domum cervice levis, gravis
aere, redibat.' For this traffic with the
country town, comp. G. 1 273, 111 400.
Tityrus blames the unthrist of Galatea
and his own recklessness which made him
take no sufficient pains about making
money by his produce, though he took it
from time to time to Mantua. There is
no reason to suppose that he squandered
his earnings directly on Galatea, which
would only complicate the passage, being

not quite consistent with the blame “

thrown on the town, v. 34.

36-39. ‘ I remember well how you
were missed, both by Amaryllis and by
the property under your charge, though
1 did, not then know that you were
awa .

37),- Amaryllis, in her sorrow, had sor-
gotten her caresul habits. She left the
fmit hanging sor TityruS, as is no hand

but his ought to gather it. ‘ Sua ’ is well
illustrated by Forb. from vn 54, ‘Strata ί
iacent passim sua quaeque sub arbore χ
poma3 G. 11 82, ‘Miratur . . . non sua
poma3’ and A. vl 206, ‘quod non sua
seminat arbos, ’

For ‘ poma' Rom. originally had
‘ mala ε ’ in Gud. too ‘ poma' appears in
an erasure.

38. ‘Aberat : ’ the short syllable
lengthened as in 111 97, etc. [See the
Excssfm at the end os the third vol.—

‘ Ipsae:’ the various parts os nature
called him back, because all suffered from
his absence, pines (comp. vn 65), springs
(comp. 11 59, v 40), and orchards, all de·
pending on his care. Thus there isa play-
sulness in the passage, which Virg. doubt·
less meant as a piece of rustic banter-
No one, except perhaps Voss, who ex-
presses himself inconsistently, seems to
tffssiolissifiiiffinfffssifichmmgss n‘L‘t,‘¹23031¹31‘3
ing to one os Voss’s explanations, that

llis made all nature echo with
her cries (in which case the enumeration
of the different objects would be jejune) ;
nor yet simply, according to the common
view, that all nature sympathized with
her, as in v 62 mountains, rocks, and
trees rejoice in Daphnis' apotheosiS, or as
in x 13 hay-trees, tamarisks, and the
pine-crowned Maenalus weep sor Gallus,
an image which would be too great for
the present occasion.

40-45. ‘ 1 could not help leaving them
both; my only chance was by getting to
Rome. And there it was that 1 saw my
deity, a glorious youth, to whom Ι pay
<livine honourS. From his lips 1 received
a firm assurance of security.’

40. ‘ Alio modo,' or something equiva-
lent, is to be supplied srom ‘alibi ' in the
next verse.
