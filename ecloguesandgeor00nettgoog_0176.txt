P. VERGILI MARON IS

infelix lolium et steriles nascuntur avenae;

pro molli viola, pro purpurea narcisso,
carduus et spinis surgit paliurus acutis,

spargite humum solii3‚ inducite sontibus umbraS,

pastores; mandat fieri sibi talia Daphnis;
et tumulum facite, et tumulo superaddite carmen:
‘ Daphnis ego in silvis, hinc usque ad sidera notuS,

⁶ hordea’ was ridiculed by Bavius and
Maevius [or, according to CledpniuS,
feralis& ςῖἳᾬζῖΐῖῗηὲἰὲῗῗῦἲήὲῗὲ
dicat‚’ uoted by Serv. on G. 1 210,
where t e offence is re ted. lt is
noticed by Quint. 1 v 1 , ‘Hordea et
mulsa nou alio vitiosa sunt, quam quod
singularia pluraliter efferunt ς ’ Pliny how·
ever uses it, xvnt 56.

37. Theophrastus on Plants‚ viu 7,
and Plin , xvm 149, are referred to by
Voss, fo owing Pierius, for the belief that
barley actually degenerated into darnel
and wild oats.

‘ Infelix ² is ‘ infecunduS,' like ‘ steriles ²
(‘ infelix oleaster,’ G. 11 314), without
reference to the rnicious properties
of darnel, which ects the head when
ground into flour. Pliny, 1. c., says
‘Loliurn et tribulos et carduos lap ue
non magis quam rubos inter rugum
morbos potius quam inter ipsius terrae
pestoe annumeravenm.’

The old reading was‘dominantur,’asin
G. 1 154 ι but ‘ nascuntur ' is found in all
Ribbeck's MSS. but one cursive. The
difference of the es quite accounts
for the change o word: Virg. is here
speaking of weeds growing instead of
barley [comp. Cic. de Fin. v 91, Cato R. R.
xxxvu 5.—H. N .], there of their grow-
ingamon the corn. ‘Lolium’and‘avena'
are coup ed by Ov. F. 1 691.

‘Purpureus' is applied to any bright
colour. So ‘ purpureis ales oloribus,'
Hor. Od. 1v i 103 ‘purpurea candi·
diora nive‚' Albinovanus 11 623 ‘ urpu·
reum lumen,’ A. 1 590, vl 540. ere it

is used of the white narcissus There was
however a narcissus with a purple calyx
(Pliny xx125): and so the Ciris, v. 96,
has ⁸ suave rubens narcissus!

39. ‘ Paliurus‚’ Christ's thorn, a prickly
shrub common in south Italy, recom-
mended by Columella for quickset hedges.
In Theocr. 1 132 foll. (imitated closely
E. vul 52) Daphnis' dying prayer is that
thorus may produce violets, and juniper-
bushes narcissus—not that a blight may
fall on things, but that the course os
nature may be changed.

4ο. This line is alluded to in tx 19,
‘ quis humum florentibus herbis Spargeret
aut viridi fontis induceret umbra? Hence
it would seem that ‘foliis’ should be in·
terzretep flowgrers, ands‘ amplias ἑ ἓξ νίζίξῑὴί

Βὲξιὶἲῗ. 88ᾚῆᾱέ ssffibfflffessffpfif
ms ). Φύλλα is used for flowers, Theocr.
xt 26, xvtu 39.

‘ Spargite ⁸ may be either sow or deck ε
the sower maybesaid either to sow the seed
directl , or to adom the turs indirectly
with e flower when sprung up. The
latter is supported by Lucr. 11 33, ‘anni
Tempora conspe nt viridantis floribus
herbas‚' the paral el passage to which, v
ι 396, has ‘ pingebant. It may be meant
that Daphnis is to be buried under the
trees. Wagn. quotes Cul. 387 fon. (of
the grave of the Culex), ‘ Rivum pro ter
aquae viridi sub fronde latentem on·
formare locum capit impiger.’

41. With ‘mandat,’ as applied to this
injunction bgque'althgtllsby the dieat?1 Daph-
nis, com . . , ‘man a novis·

‘ In silvis ' answers
