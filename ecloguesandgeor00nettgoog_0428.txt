P. VERGILI MARONIS

set frustra oppositum trudentes pectore montem
comminus obtruncant ferro, graviterque rudentis

caedunt, et magno laeti clamore reportant.

ipsi in defossis specubus secura sub alta

advolvere focis ulmos ignique dedere.

the hunters stretched along the openings
os the woods to drive the game into the
net (Sen. de Ira 11 12), its Greek appella-
tion being μήρινθος. Here Virg. pro·
bably so sar reverts to the common
meanin as to make ⁸ formidine ¹ the terror
inspiredgby the seathers.

373. They are immersed in the snow‚
and try in vain to push it before them.
[‘Sed pat—H. N.]

374. ‘ Rudere,’ properly used of asses,
is transferred to lions, A. vu 16, to the
monster CacuS‚ A. vlu 248, and even to
the prow ofa vessel, A. 111561. So ‘ bray’
is sometimes used of a deer in English
(though, according to Scott, Marmion tv
16, note, ‘ bell ’ is more appropriate), and
Spenser makes a tiger ‘ bray!

376. This Troglodytic lise is reported
of the Sarmatians by Mela 11 1, of the
Germans by Tac. Germ. 16, of the Ar-
menians by Xenophon, an eye-witness,
Anab. zv 5. In Aesch. Prom. 452 it is part
os the barbarism from which Prometheus
raised thehuman tace: κατώρυχες δ ἔναιον,
ὥστ’ ἀήσυροι Μύρμηκες, ἄντρων ἐν μυχοῖς
ἀνηλίοις. ‘ Ipsi ' distinguishes their own
lise from the state of things about them.

379. ‘ Noctem,’ the whole time during
which storms prevail and the sun does not
shine.

‘ Ducunt :² ‘noctem sermone trahe·
bat,’ A. 1 748; ‘ nos flendo ducimus
horaS‚’ A. vl 539. It is difficult to say
whether the notion is that of speeding
along or of drawing out. Here the natural
length of the winter night is a reason for
..i⁰{;rfds¹¹f.²¹2¹r.2zzsszz‚0iz
benigno tendere noctem,' the meaning is
that the natural shortness of the summer

night is to be counteracted by the pleasure
of conversation.

‘ Pocula,’ a draught (1 9: Ε. vm 28).
In the sense of a cup it could hardly stand
with ‘ vitea,' which would have to be un·
(ὲεῐεῐοοάὁοί the wood, like ‘ pocula fagina,’

. 111 3 .

380. ‘ Fermento: ’ Virg. evidentlymeans
beer, the national drink of Germany‚ Gaul,
and other countries (Tac. Germ. 2 3 ς Pliny
xiv 1493 xxn 164). But it is not clear
whether he uses ‘ fermento ² of fermented
grains, or mistakes the process, supposing
that leaven is used.

‘ Sorbis: ' a kind os cider seems to have
been made from service berries, Pliny xlv
1033 Palladius however (11 15) speaks as
if he only knew it by hearsay. It is pos·
sible‚ though scarcely likely, that ‘ ser—
mento atque sorbis ' may be for ‘ sorbis
fermentatis? according to a suggestion os
Martyn‘s adopted by Wagn.

381. ‘ Septem trioni ι’ ⁸ septemtriones ‘
were the seven stars of Ursa Major. con-
ceived by the Romans as seven oxen
(‘ triones boves appellantur a bubulcis'
Varro). The plural form is of course older
than the sing. ε compare ‘ decemviri, de·
cemvir.’ The tmesis is used in the pl.
{ac} N. D. 1141, in the sing. by Ovid

1 4·

382. ‘ Effrena ε ’ denoting the freedom
ossavage life. ‘ Riphaeo: 1 240. Dryden’s
rendering of this and the preceding line is
anliautsing, effen weHccipsiccller tellieEvarioug
re tons ween o an an an
in his day ε ‘ Such are the cold Rynghean
race, and such The savage Scythiam, and
unwarlike Dutch.’

383. ‘ Velatur ’ (Rom., Pal„ Gud.)
was restored by Heius. sor ‘ velantur '
