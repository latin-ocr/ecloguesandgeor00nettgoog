10. ‘ Petulci ε ’ an epithet of lambs in
Luer. 11 368 [quoted with this line of
Virg. by Verrius F1aoeus(Fest. p. 206 M),
whence Macrob. Sat. vx ¹5, may have got
hisnote.-H. N.] [‘Aedi Rom—H. N.]

ιι. Understand ⁸ ubi,’ from ‘quo,’ be·

fore ⁸ insultent.’

H[‘1⁸?ucu¹a, Pal. and so Ribbeck.—

‘Cainpoz’ abl. with ‘errans ’ [A. 11
489, 111 204, 1x 393⁷„ etc. 3 Roby 1173].

13. ‘ Squalentia [denotes rouffmess
only, as m 11 348, ‘squalentes infode
conchas ’ and the common ‘ auro squalenS,’
below v. 91, etc.]

‘ squalentia terga lacerti ’ is sor ‘lacer-
tus squalenti terg0.' Comp. A. 1 634,
⁴horrentia centum Terga suum ς’ Α. lv
511. Col. (lx 7) speaks of the lizard,

qui velut custos vestibuli prodeuntibus
apibus affert exitium,' recommending as a
safeguard that the hive should have two or
three entrance&
c . ν ·
..0¹53 &⁵²33ss 'as &2322ss ἐς) ἓίῖῖἆξῗ
peacocks, and even fish. ‘ Pinguibus ’
'ves the reason why care should be taken.
ed. has ‘ab stabuliS,’ which Forb. and
Ladewig adopt.

⁶ Meropes: ' the ‘ merops apiaster L.,'
or bec-eater. ‘ It is like the swallow, os
the fissirostral tribe, and, like it als0‚
hunts insects on the wing. Its bill is
long and slender, slightly curved3 its
wings long and pointed. The “ mero s ''
usually visit Greece and Italy in ocks
os from twenty to thirty3 they very
rarely stray so far north as England’
(Keightley).

‘Aliaeque volucres,’ which Heyne
thinks feeble, is explained by Wagn. as
equivalent to the Greek idiom‚ ἄλλα τε
πτηνὰ καὶ Πρόκνη. He does not however
produce any similar instance in Latin,
and previous specification of ‘ meropes '

shows that ‘ aliae' means ‘ other than
what precedes,' not ‘other than what
follova.' The phrase is probably a mere
piece of inartificial writing.

15. ‘ Procne :’ E. vl 78.

‘Manibus cruentis:' the blood which
stained her hands dropped upon her
breast. Such at least is the interpreta-
tion suggested by Ov. M. vt 669, ‘ neque
adhuc de pectore caedis Excessere notae,
signataque sanguine pluma est! Other-
wise it would seem more naturai to under·
stand the words of her boeting her breast
³23 ffissssffif‘sszf. ῗζξῃὶξ ιῗῗέἑξωφω’“’ ³¹¹3
as a lament sor Itys,

The hostility of the swallow to bees
as well as of the hee-eater is mentioned by
Aristot. H. A. xx 40, Geopon. xv 2, and
Aelian v 11, and others. [Thompson's
Glossary of Greek Birds‚ pp. 117, 191.]
16. ⁸ Ipsas’ opposed to ‘ omnia! [No-
nius, p. 459, reads ‘ipsae.'—H. N.]

‘ Volantis' is commonly taken as a
substantive, but it seems rather to mean
that bees are caught on the wing.

17. ‘Nidis ε ’ Col. vn 9 actually usa
‘ nidus ’ os a litter os pigs—‘ in cubili suam
quisque matrem nidus exspectat,’ but this
13 iprobp3bly poetical imitation rather than
1 oma ic rose.

‘ Immiti'bus ε ’ the epithetis transferred
from the nestlings to the nest, as A. ΧΠ
475, ‘hirundo Pabula parva legens, ni-
disque loquacibus escas, and perhaps A.
v 214.

18-32. ‘Let the hive be placed near
water, and overshadowed by a tree, under
which the bees can take refuge from the
heat of a spring noon. Stones or branches
should be thrown into the water as bridges
where they can dry themselves is they get
wet. There should be casia, wild thyme.
savmy, and violets near.’ Compare sor
vv. 30·3² Plin. N. H. xxx 70.
