et visco et Phrygiae servant pice lentius Idae.

saepe etiam effossis, si vera est fama, latebris

sub terra fovere larem, penitusque repertae
pumicibusque cavis exesaeque arboris antro,

tu tamen et levi rimosa cubilia limo 45

neu propius tectis taxum sine neve rubentis

4ο. ‘Haec ipsaadmunerae’ ‘adlinenda
spiramenta et explendas oras.’

41. ‘Visco‚’ 1 139. ‘Pice Idae‚’ 111
460. ‘Phrygiae Idae,’ A. 111 6. Pal.
has ‘ tentiuS.

42. ‘ Effossis ’ is commonly explained of
holes formed by nature or b man. How-
ever, some bees make holes or themselves.

43. ‘Fovere larem,' 111 420. The
perf. is gnomic or (as it is also led)
aoristic, as often in the Augustan poets
and later writers. Comp·. 11 210, below
R ἴῃ, Ἑξοτῇ Ep. 1 ii 47. Dr'ager i p. 254,

o 14 9.

⁴ odere,' the old reading before Heins.,
supported by Med.‚ is obviously wrong.

44. ‘ Pumicibus ε ’ comp. the similes
A. ΧΠ 587 and 11. 11 87, where the bees
issue πέτρης ἐκ γλαφυρῆς. The line is an
echo of G. 11 453, ‘Corticibusque cavis
vitiosaeque ilicis alv0,’ where see note.

45. The same precept is given by Col.
lx 14, Varro 111 16, etc.

‘Et leviz' SerV. mentions a variant,
‘ e levi,' which occurs also in some of the
cursives z it is plainly wrong.

46. ⁴ Fovens‚' because one object is to
keep out the cold air. Wagn. says he
should have expected ‘ densaS, not ‘ raras!
Keightley rephes that the poet knew leaves
do not lie close when spread on anything.

‘bbeckJ would place them aster v. 17.
The question there was about choosing a
ne' hbourhood sor the bees where they
mig t ex tiate without injury: Virg. 1s
now s ing oi the hive, and after direct-
ing that it should be made westher-tight‚
he naturally passes on to speak about
smells and sounds which might penetrate

it and injure the inmates. Heyne con-
ceded that if the Georgics had been a dog-
matic treatise, the lines might have found
place after v. 17, and Ribbeck avails him·
self of the concession, supposi that they
rqatylv³ have been added after the t edition
o e m.

⁶ Teffiess' the hiveS, as above, v. 38.

‘ Taxum,' E. 1x 30 (note).

[‘ Rubentis: ' ‘cum uruntur, quia non
sunt per naturam huius coloris.'—Serv.]

48. [Burnt crabs had several uses. The Α

smoke was thought good for trees suffering
from ‘carbunculus (Pliny xvnl 293).
The ashes were employed in certain human
ailments both by the Romans (Pliny xxxn
119, etc.) and in mediaeval times (Cock·
ayne’s Lcechdoms ii 44).]

‘ Crede ’ is probably intransitive, ⁴‘ do
not trust a marsh ' being uivalent to
‘do not calculate on it as li ely not to
smell.’ So probably A. v11 97, ‘thalamis
neu crede paratis! In the next‘ line
‘ locis ' may easily be supplied from ‘ ubi.'

49. The dislike of bees for strong smells
is vouched sor by various authorities
(Cerda). Thus Pliny (xl 61) says that
they attack persons who are strongly
persumed; Col. (lx 14) that they are
are angry at those who smell of wine.

‘Pulsu,’ with the impact of a sound.
The two clauses state the same thing.

50. Virg. seems to have been thinking
of Lucr. lv 570, ⁸ Pars (vocum) solidis
adlisa locis reiecta sonorem Reddit, et
interdum frustratur imagine verbi. ’ Varro
(111 xvi 12) recommends placing bee·hin
⁸ tissimum ubi non resonant imagines,'
w ich with Cic. Tusc. 111 2, ‘ea virtuti
resonant, tanquam imag0,’ would seem to
show that ‘ imago ' was a received word for·
