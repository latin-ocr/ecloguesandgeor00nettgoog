aurea mala decem misi; cras altera mittam.

D. O quotiens et quae nobis Galatea locuta est!

Thus there is no reason to understand

‘ Aeriae' occurs in Lucr. 1 12, v 825, as
an epithet of ⁸ volucres' as we say birds
of the air: here, however, it means
making their nats high in air, like ‘ aeria
turtur ab ulm0,’ 1 58, and reminds us that
the intended gift is hazardous.

‘Co essere,’ for ‘ nidum congessere’
(Plaut. ud. 111 vi 5), as we say to build.
‘ Apes in alvarium co esserant,' Cic.
Oecon. in Charis. p. 82 . 50 ‘ tendere '
for ‘ tentoria tendere ' A. 11 29, etc.

vm 52, golden‚ i.e. ripe and ruddy; not
a particular kind of ‘malum,’ such as
quinces or pomegranates. Prop. 111 xxvi
69, referring to this sage, has simply
‘ mala.’ Spohn well observes that ‘quod
potui ' con-es nds to ² aeriae,’ both de·
noting difficu ily. He has done his best
for to·day (re erring to the quality, not
to the quantity of his presents), and
promises to give the same to·morrow.

says to me; things that the gods might
listen to Σ M‚ Amyntas, you love me ς do
not separate from me in hunting.’

72. From this line to 1v 52 Pal. is
defective. Rom. is the only principa]
MS. here extant, though Gud. to some
extent supplies the place of Pal.

73. ‘ Let not such precious words be
wholly lost, but convey some part at least
to the ear of the gods.' Comp. Theocr.
vn 93. So Apollo listens to the nightin·
gale's song. Aristoph. Birds, 217. Those

who, like Heyne and Voss», suppose that
the gods are requested to hear Galatea’s
vows and punish her perjury, quite mis·
take the passage.

says: ‘Ambarvalis hostia est, quae rei

Rom. and the rest of Ribbeck’s MSS.
read ‘vitulam:’ but Serv„ Priscian and
Macrob. Sat. 111 2 are for ‘vitula’ which

Pierius found in some old copies. It should '

be remembered that we have not the evi-
dence of Pal. and Med. , The accusative is
