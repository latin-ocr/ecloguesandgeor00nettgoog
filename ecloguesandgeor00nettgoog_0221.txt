57. Apparently imitated from Theocr-
ιῐ 38, ἠνίδε, σιγῇ μὲν πόντος, mrem-c δ’
ἀῆται, so that ‘aequor' seems to be the
sea, the scenery being taken from Sicily.
Neither the context nor the e of
the line itself suits the swamp o the

that you may sing.

58. ‘Ventosi murmuris’ is apparently
uivalent to ‘venti murmurantiS,' wit
w ich ‘ aurae ’ is naturally connected, like
‘ Zephyri tepentibus auriS‚' G. 11 330,
quoted by Voss. Virg. probably intended
a variation on the more natural expression,
⁶ ventosae murmura aurae.' Tlns seems
better than with Heyne to make ‘mur-
muris,' the attributive genitive, like ‘ ve·

neni,‘ 1v 24.

‘ Cadere,’ of winde„ G. 1 354.

59. ‘Adeo ' throws stress on ‘hinc '
(see on lv 11), or on ‘media.’ The line
is from Theocr. vn ro, εσῦπω τὰν μεσάταν

stripping os leaveS, which were used sor
sodder‚ G. 1 305, 11 368, Hor. Ep. 1 xiv
28. ⁸ Oleam ubi nigra erit stringit0,'
Cato, R. R. 65. Col. x1 2, 565 (referred
to by Keightley) says that the ‘ frondatio ’
should be done ‘ antelucanis et vespertinis
temporibus!
