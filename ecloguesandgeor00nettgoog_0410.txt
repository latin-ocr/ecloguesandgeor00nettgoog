P. VERGILI MARONIS

iunge pares, et coge gradum conferre iuvencos;

atque illis iam saepe rotae ducantur inanes

per terram, et summo vestigia pulvere signent;
post valido nitens sub pondere faginus axis
instrepat, et iunctos temo trahat aereus orbis.
interea pubi indomitae non gramina tantum,

nec vescas salicum frondes ulvamque palustrem,

sed frumenta manu carpes sata; nec tibi fetae,
more patrum, nivea implebunt mulgaria vaccae,
sed tota in dulces consument ubera natos.

may = ‘ yoke.’ The other exx. of this
sense are very late.]

step together may still be seen in the
south of F rance (Keightley). ‘ Pares ’

174. ‘ Interea2’ calves were broken in
when they were three years old. Virg.
probably means now to s ak os their
treatment previously, thoug the want of
precision in his language leaves his inten-
tion uncertain.

⁶ F etae,' v. 176, points to a still earlier
stage, before the calves are weaned. Thus
the order of time is exactly reversed.

‘Gramina' either ( 1) means hay (or
perhaps grass cut green), or (2) is to be
understood as joined by zeugma to
‘ carpes‚’ the meaning being that, besides
ἔπαιζε, they are to have corn gathered
or t em.
