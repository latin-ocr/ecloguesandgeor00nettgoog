times round the region, it is supposed to
enclose parts of it between each sold.

‘Intima Tartara·’ is rightly made by

‘ Implexae ’ (Med. originally, Serv.) is
explained by Serv. as ‘ involutae, implici-
tae.' Wagn. cites Hor. Epod. v 15,
‘ canidia brevibus implicata viperis Crines
et.incomptum caput) ‘ Capillus horrore
implexus et im itus 'is quoted by Fore.
from Apul. T e sense here seems to be
that the Furies had snakes twisted among
their hair, i.e. growing from their heads
and matted or entwining themselves with
the natural hair. For the acc. see 337 note.

Med. corr. and the Berne scholia have
‘ impexae,' which occurs in a parallel

483. ‘ Inhian5‚’ agape on Orpheus·

‘Tenuit ora ’ may include both abstin-
ence from barking and fixedness of coun-
tenance. See on A. 11 1, where the ad·
verbial use of ‘intenti' will illustrate
⁴ inhians ’ here.

484. ‘ Rota orbis ' is difficult. We may
either (1) make ‘ orbis' a genitive of
quality, as we might say in prose ‘ a wheel
os circular form.’ [Mr. J. S. Reid observes
that Latin poets often use a enitive of
quality (with adjective) identi or almost
identical in meaning to the noun which
governs the genitive: so Prop. 1 iv 7 ‘ sor-

would not need to be supgortteedrgy explicit
instanceS, such as those which Voss
adduces and F orb. controverts. In E. 11
58, ‘ ventosi murmurisaurae,' the difficulty
is somewhat similar.

‘ Vento constitit ε ’ ‘ placidum ventis

still (Serv. ). [Philarg. suggests that
⁴ ventu '= ‘ adventu ’ is the true reading.—
H. N. The same explanation, among
otherS, is given by Daniel’s Sena]
485-503. ‘ He was returning, followed
by his wife, and just on the point of
emerging from Hell, when in a moment of
forgetfulness he broke the condition im-
and looked back upon her. She
ed, complainin loudly of his madness
and her fate, an he was not allowed to
return to seek her.’

485. Virg. simply indicates the vmg
of the consent by the epithet ‘reddum
and only mentions the condition paren·
thetically as an after-thought. This mode
of telling the story was doubtless ado ed
