LIFE OF VIRGIL. xxi

phasellus. The eighth‚ ‘Villula quae Sironis eraS,' purports to be written
by Virgil in the year 41, when he was flying from his home. He
addresses the villa of his master Siron, and implores it to give shelter
and a home to him and his father. This poem has as good a claim to
acceptance as any in the collection 3 but the thirteenth‚ the author of
which speaks of himself as a soldier accustomed to hard campaigning‚
cannot possibly be by Virgil. The third (‘ Aspice quem valido subnixum
gloria regno ³) may very well, as 1 have argued elsewhere,¹ apply to
Phraates, and in that case must belong to the year 32 ne„ the thirty-
eighth os Virgil’s age. Considering this fact it can hardly, perhapS‚
be pronounced worthy os him. Of the sixth and the twelfth all that
σιω be said is that they are lampoons in the manner os Catullus. Two
poems (4 and 11) are addressed apparently to Octavius Musa, an
historian of note. The authorship both of these and the rest of the
collection remains at present uncertain.

5 4. But, whatever be the case with regard to these poems, we must
look to the Eclogues and Georgics is we would learn anything of the
studies and political leanings of Virgil's early manhood. To take
the last point first, it must never be forgotten that Virgil's boyhood
was passed in the full blaze of Julius Caesar’s glory. Virgil was a boy
of fifteen when Caesar invaded Britain ; an expedition which impressed
the fancy even of the hostile Catullus. And there were nearer ties
which bound Virgil's native country to Caesar. In 49 nc. (the twenty·
first of Virgil's age) Caesar, who had for nineteen years been patron of
Gallia Transpadana, conferred full Roman citizenship on its inhabitants.
The whole career of the Dictator must, in fact, have deeply impressed
the imagination of the young poet. The literary men of the previous
generation had mostly espoused the cause of the republic; but a change,
for which the course of events quite sufficiently accountS, began with
Sallust, VirgiL and VariuS. If the fifth Eclogue is rightly referred to
Julius Caesar, we may take this poem as well as the conclusion of the
first Georgic as Virgil's tribute to the man whom he regarded as the
saviour of his country.

Turning now to Virgil's early studieS, it is clear from the Eclogues
and the Georgics that they were mainly devoted to the Alexandrian
poets, and among the Roman poets to Lucretius (witness the sixth
Eclogue), to Helvius Cinna, and to Varius, These last he expressly
mentions as writers whose same he would fain emulate if he could.8
Helvius Cinna, whose poem on Smyrna, admired of Catullus, had
