THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. xci

Macrobius (l. c.) quotes Haterianus as his authority for saying that
the poet and orator Calvus used deus as a feminine noun 3 a usage which
he illustrates also from Virgil and Sallust. The same instances from
Virgil and Sallust are given in a note in Donatus on Terence Eun. v ii
36 3 it may therefore be that Haterianus and Donatus are both drawing
² on an older source. The other remarks attributed to Haterianus do
not give a high idea of his capacity ‚· e.g. his proposal on A. x 242
(‘quem dedit ipse Invictum Ignipotens ') to read εζητ· for ψει, and
construet it with invictum, ‘ unconquerable by fire.'

14. THE VERONA SCHOLIA.

These scholia, written on the margin of the Verona palimpsest‚ are
mentioned here on account of a quality which, as it immensely enhances
their value, seems to me also to have some bearing upon their date. I
allude to the fact that in the Verona scholia, far more than in the
commentaries of Philargyrius and Servius, the names are given of the
scholars from whose works the notes are derived. The names of
CornutuS, Asper, Velius LonguS‚ Terentius ScauruS, Sulpicius Apol-
linariS‚ and Haterianus are mentioned far oftener, in proportion to the
extent of the remaining fragments of these scholia, than in the later
commentaries. This phenomenon seems to me to indicate that they Ἰ

 

are older than the time of Servius and Philargyrius, whose characteristic
it is», on the whole, to say little or nothing of their authorities. Ι am
inclined to attribute this not so much to deliberate intention on their
part, as to the fact that in course of time the names of the older scholars
who had originally gathered the stores of Virgilian learning ‘gradually
vanished from the commentaries, Philargyrius and Servius may have
used as their immediate sources of information not the ancient com-
mentaries themselves, but compendia or handbooks compiled from them.
Nothing on the other hand strikes the reader so much in the fragments
which remain of the Verona scholia as their air of genuine antiquity‚
their clearness, fulness, and sanity of view, Even in their fragmentary
condition they embody a great deal of valuable information, evidently
drawn from very good sources, on points of grammar and lexicography.
To take a single instance: the lexicographical notes on arma, cana, oras,
altus, insignis, at the beginning of the commentary on the Aeneid, are
far fuller than the corresponding notes in ServiuS, and that on z'nstjgmlr
fuller even than the corresponding note in N onius p. 331. It mayl
fairly be said that wherever the Verona scholia have been preserved, it ,
is the first duty of a modern commentator to consult them. Readers .
who have followed this essay so far will have already derived some ¹
notion of the quality of the Verona scholia from the quotations made
in the sections on Asper and Velius Longus ε and they have been cited
in the course of the commentary wherever any light is to be derived
from thern.

Whether these scholia were compiled before the time of Donatus
and Servius or not, their composition cannot be dated earlier than the
