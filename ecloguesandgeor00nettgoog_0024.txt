xx LIFE OF VIRGIL.

come down to us under that name, and which concludes as Suetonius
says Virgil's poem concluded. Suetonius is not alone responsible for
this statement, for a literary tradition as old as Luoen' assigned this
piece to Virgil's youth or boyhood. The poem is poor enough in itself,
and (as Mr. Munro has pointed out to me) stands sufficiently con-
demned on metrica] grounds. For the author of the Culex is oereful
in the matter os elisions,² never, if possible, allowing two long vowels
to coalesce. This strictness is inconceivable in Virgil's youth. A poet
who even in his ripest work allowed himself the greatest freedom in
eliding vowels is not likely to have been preternaturally scrupulous in
his seventeenth year.⁸

No one now thinks of attributing the Ciris or the Aetna to Virgil.
The workmanship of the Copa and the Moretum is not unworthy of
the Augustan age3 but this does not, of course, prove that they are
from the hand os Virgil.

Of the short poems known under the various names of Catalecton,
Catalepta, and Catalecta, but more rightly, as Bergk and Unger have
shown, named Catalepton (τὰ κατα λεπτόν, or minor poems), the second,
‘ Corinthiorum amator iste verborum,' is expressly attributed to Virgil by
Quintilian (vm iii 27), though even this testimony cannot be accepted
as conclusive. of the fifth, ‘ Ite hinc inance, ite, rhetorum ampullae,' Ι
have already spoken 3 there seems no reason to doubt the genuineness
of the tenth, ‘ Sabinus ille quem videtis hospite5,’ a pasody of Catullus'

Culicem, Priapeia, catalepton‚ epigrammata, Copam, diras-³ 1 doubt whether these
two statements can be taken as independent. There is considerable critical difficulty
about the passage. In Suetonius the Canonician MS. , which, though late, represents
a good tradition, reads moretum for catalepton .· and Servius’ words septem sive octo
require explanation. My own opinion is that Suetonius wrote deinde Culicem cum
esset annorum xvi, and that the rest is an interpolation. Servius' septem sive octo
Ι should explain by supposing that epzjgmmmata and catalepton refer to the same
set of minor poenis: that one word was written over the other as an explanation,
and thus crept into the text, and that the scribe, in doubt whether to count epigram-
mata and catalepton as two sets of poems or one, saved his conscience by adding sive
octo after septem. Baehrens, however, in his edition os these poems (Leipzig, 1880),
accepts the text of Suetonius and ServiuS, whom he treats as independent authorities,
as genuine, and contends that the title catalepton includes all the minor poems
attributed to Virgil, and that the true title of the short pieces is epigrammata or
praelusiones. 1 agree with him that epigrammata would be a very good term to
designate the short pieces, but Ι doubt whether τὰ κατὰ λεπτόν could include the
larger oneS, and suspect that epigrammata and catalepton were synonymous.

² Baehrens also lays stress upon this point in the work just quoted (p. 26).

⁸ [Prof. R. Ellis (Classical Rev. x 183) ascribes the Culex to some imitator ot
Virgil, familiar with the Georgius and possibly with the Aeneid, who wrote not very
long after Actium]
