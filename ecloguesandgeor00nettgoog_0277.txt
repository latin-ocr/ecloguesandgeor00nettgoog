14. ‘ Cultor nemorum :’ Aristaeuj,(G.
lv 315 soll.); he delivered—'Ceos from
drought, and he was honoured there with
the attributes of Zeus.

‘ Cultor' [either (1) cultivator. as Con·
ington thought3 or (2)inhabitant: comp.
A. 111 111, ‘Cybelae cultrix,’ xl 557, ‘ ne·
morum cultrix ' (see note), Plaut. Am h.
v i 13, Iuppiter ‘ caeli cultor‚' etc. he
second explanation is better supported,
and comes nearer to the sense ‘patron,’
which (as Con. says) is here the general
sense. Comp. Corpus Inscr. Lat. νη 980,
‘ dis cultoribus huius loci '].

‘ Cui ’ implies that the process goes on
sor him, because he is its patron and
author. Comp. 11 53 Lucr. lvii 8, ‘tibi
suavis daedala tellus Summittit flores:
tibi rident aequora ponti.'

‘ Pinguia,' luxuriant.
guissima' Pliny xxx 53, ‘ coma inguis-
sima' Suet. Ner. 20. ln Ceos t e wild
fig-tree was said to bear three times ayear‚
Athen. 111 p. 77, quoted by Cerda.

15. ‘ Pascuntur . . . amantis ardua
dumos,' 111 315. ‘Ter centum,' indefi-
nite, like ‘trecentae catenae,’ Hor. Od.
111 iv 79 [es . common in Catullus and
Virg. : wel in's Archiv ix 189].

[⁴ Dummeta ' originally Pal.—H. N .]

16. ‘Come thou too in thy power from
thy sorest home and the Lycaean lawns,
Pan, tender of sheep, by the love thou
bearest thy MaenaluS, and stand graciously
at my side, god of Tegea.' ⁶ lpse,'as the

semblance would be closer is we were to
read ‘seu' sor ‘si' with Schrader3 but
‘si’ is sufficiently defended by v 7.
⁸ Lycaei,' E. x 15.

17. ‘ Ovium custos‚' the shepherd κατ’
ἐξοχὴν. ‘ Maenalus,' E. v111 21, x 55.

18. ‘Calami, Pan Tegeaee, tui‚'Prop. ιν
iii 30. For the story of Minerva see v. 13.

So ⁸ folia pin·

19. Triptolemus comes naturally after
Minerva, as the legend connected both with
Attica. Other stories represented Osiris
as the inventor of the plough (Tibull. 1
vii 29), and this is the view os Serv. here:
but ‘puer’ points to Triptolemus, who
appears in [ovid Met. v 645 and on] works
os art as a youth.

‘ Monstrator z ² ‘sacri monstrator iniqui,’
Ov. Ibis 399. So ‘monstrata piacula.⁸
A. ιν 636, the expiations prescribed by
the priestoes. [‘ Mostrator' originally
Med„ and so Ribbeck—H. N.]

20. Silvanus (E. x 24) is re resented
in sculpture with a cypress in is hand,
and hence called δενδροφόρος. His con·
nexion with the cypress is accounted for
by the legend os his attachment to Cypa-
rissus (Serv.), an Italianized· version of
one of the mythes of Apollo.

‘ Ab radice ’ with ‘ferens,’ condensed, as
Catullus Lxlv 288, ⁸ tulit radicitus.' Serv.
mentions a variant ‘ tenera.’

21. SerV. says that the pontiffs, after
invok‘ the gods whose aid was specially
requir in the particular case, concluded
with a eneral invocation. The namesof
some o the rural deities os Italy may be
found in Varr0, R. R. 1 13 others are
given by Serv. srom Fabius Pictor. Ur·
sinus quotes Prop. ιν xiii 41, ‘ Dique
deaeque pmnea quibus ‘est tutela per
εεῖοὸςῖυεῗζιῃῐῖιεῗιῑιιέτὶῗρῐιῐπξξὲῗοὲἐε note on v.
213. In the case of ‘ studium ' perhaps it
is most natural to regard the infinitive as
a nominative, and make it the subject of
the proposition. But in 111 179, 180
⁸ studium ’ certainly seems to be the sub·

ject‚ ‘ praelabi’ being connected with it,

like ‘ad bella‚' probably in a gerundia}
construction, as is it had been ‘studium
bellandi, aut praelabendi.' -

Berne scholia) was restored by Heins-
