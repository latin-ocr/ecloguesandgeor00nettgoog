258. ‘ Parem ' is intended to contrast
with ‘diversis ’ (Serv. ). The seasons are
diverse, yet as they are of equal lengthS,
and succeed each other regularly, they
make the year uniform. ⁸ speculamur '

employments 3 so have holy days.’

259. Hitherto Virg. has been insisting
on the importance of the weather: he
now shows that weather which is bad for
ordinary out-door purposes is good sor
other thi . ‘ Frigidus imber ’ cannot
apply to ntffise winter, on account of ‘ si
quando ι’ besides, winter occupations are
mentioned vv. 305 soll. ⁶ Frigidus ' is an
ordinary epithet os rain, as chilling the air,
just as ‘ hiemps’ is used indifferently os
storm and winter.

‘ Continet,' keeps him from his work:
confines him to the house. ‘ Dum secon-

23. Cato (xl) mentions them among the
apparatus for a vineyard, saying that two
are required sor a vineyard of 100 jugera.
They a pear to have been the same as ‘na-
viae ' (gest. p. 169, s.v. ‘ navia '), which
were made from a single piece ot wood,
and were so called from their resemblance
to ships or canoes, whence both names·

263. [He stamps a scal sor (marking)
his cattle or tickets sor (numbering) his
heaps of corn. ‘ Facit aut characteras

uibus pecora signantur aut tesseras quibus
ramentorum numerus designatur ' (δεῖν. ).
No instance of ‘imprimere signum‚’=
make a stamp, is quoted in the lexx„ but
there is nothing in such a phrase which
violates Latinity.—H. N .] Brandingcattle
is mentioned 111 158.

[⁸ Impressit: ’ the perfect in a series os
present tenses may possibly be used because
stamping a seal or ticket is a single action,
hollowing a tree, etc.‚ a prolonged one.—
Marindin.]

264. The ‘ valli ' and ‘furcae ' were
probably to support the vines. See 11 359.

265. Col. (tv 30), speaking of willows
sor tying up the vine (‘ salices vimi-
nales ’), enumerates three sorta Greek,
Gallie, and Sabine or Amerian‚ the last
os which has a slender red twig.

remarks. Pal. has ‘facili'

(Hor. S. 1 v 94); but there is no reason
to suppose that the twigs there were good
sor basket·making.
