THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lvii

ingenii et facundiae praecellentis! An observation for which ‚he may be
indebted either to Hyginus or to Verrius FlaccuS, in whose works it is
probable that there was a not inconsiderable amount of common matter.

(2) Gellius xvi vi 15 preserves a note of Hyginus upon the word
bidens, which he interprets as meaning a sheep with the two prominent ⁰
teeth which mark its full growth. Whether this interpretation was due
to Hyginus or to Verrius F laccuS, whether either of them borrowed it
from the other, or both adopted it independently, cannot be ascertained
with certainty: but it is worth notice that the explanation adopted by
Hyginus is identical with that given in Paulus p. 33, S. v. bidental. In
Aen. vl 15, he found fault with the expression praepetibus pennis:¹ His
objection is not expressly noticed in the commentary of Servius, wh0,
however, appears to be tacitly replying to it. And in vu 187, he
criticised the zeugma lituo et succinctus trabea?

(3) Hyginus, who had made considerable studies in Roman history,
was not slow to observe the error by which Virgil in the sixth Aeneid
(837) confuses the conquerors of Macedonia and of Greece.² ServiuS,
again without mentioning Hyginus, is at the pains to attempt a solution
of the difficulty which cannot be called successful. The same is the
case with Hyginus' remark on Aen. v1 359, that Velia was not founded
at the time when Aeneas is represented as coming thither 3 ¹ and with
his observation that Theseus is spoken of at one time as remaining in
hell for ever, and in another as an instance of a hero who had returned
thence (Aen. vr 122, 617). Asthe name of Hyginus is not mentioned
in these cases by ServiuS‚ it is natural to infer that his criticisms were
only known to the later commentator at second or third hand. There
are instanceS, however, in which Servius mentions Hyginus by name.
Thus he is quoted on Aen. 1 277, 530, on points connected. with the
early history of Rome and Italy; and so on Aen. 11 15, and vu 47.
His work De Urbibus Italicis is mentioned in general terms by Servius

on Aen. vn 678, and that De Familiis Troianis on¹ Aen. v 389. Both '

works were probably much used by the later commentators on Virgil,
and much of their contents may have found its way into Servius,

4. IULIUS MODESTUS.

Ribbeck conjectures that this scholar, the freedman of Hyginus
(Suetonius De Illustribus Grammaticis 20), who commented on Horace,
made also some scattered remarks upon Virgil. I am not aware, how-
ever, that any Virgilian notes are in existence which can with certainty
be referred to him. The name of 'Aufidius Modestus occurs (if the
rmding be certain) in a note by Philargyrius on the words com'urato
Histro (Georg. 11 497); but can we be certain that the same person is
intended? Ribbeck thinks that the long note in Nonius, p. 377, on
tenus and protinus comes from the Quaestiones confusae of Iulius
Modestus. And undoubtedly Philargyrius on Georg. 111 53 (crurum
lmus) remarkS, Modestus tenus pro fine accipit, and Nonius says ipsum
