seems to have had in his mind AratuS,
Phaen. v. 1 (quoted by Serv. );

Another interpretation, mentioned by
Serv„ and adopted by Ribbeck, makes
‘ Musae ’ genitive. This is su ported by
Cicero’s translation of Aratus (ge Leg. 11
3), ‘Ab Iove Musarum rimordia, 'and
ove principium
generis3 ’but Theocr. 1. c. and Ov. M.
x 148, ‘Ab Iove, Musa parens (cedunt
Iovis omnia regno) Carmina nostra move,’

defend the vocative The question is as
nearly balanced as possible.

61. ‘Ille colit terrasss Jupiter (the sk )
impregnates the earth and makes it fruit ul
(comp. G. 11 326), so that he is here
said to cultivate the earth.

‘Illi mea carmina curae, ’because they
celebrate the gifts of earth. Serv„ how·
ever, renders ‘colit,' ‘stamat uoting
A. 115 unam Posthabita coluisse amo,’
where see note.

62. Damoetas had secured as his patron
the father of the gods and the givet of
the plenty which, as Palaemon remarked,
they saw around them: Menalcas meets
him by naming a god who has specially
toe do with poetry, and referring not to

eneral bounty of nature, but to the
ΕΞ

uce of his own special labour, which
offers to that god as his due. In
Theocr. v 80·83‚ Cometes names the
Muses, Lacon Apollo, each mentioning

E

his offerings as the ground of his favour
with his patron.

63. The bay and hyacinth are gifts of
Apollo to man, and so are appropriately
restored to him in sacrifice. Menalcas
has a garden, like Corydon, 11 45, where
lAe llzleeps these plants with a view to

mean indirectly to boast that he rs beloved
by two persons, not merely by one, like
Damoetas· The language of v. 66 is rather
in favour of this latter view, as otherwise
we should have expected some allusion to
