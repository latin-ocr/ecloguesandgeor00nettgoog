224 P. VERGILI MARONIS

LIBER SECUNDUS.

THE: subject of this book is the culture of trees, especially of the vine, but there is no
great regularity in the mode of treatment. Virgil opens with an enumeration os the
different ways of propagating trees, natural and artificial, so as to indicate the magnitude
ot' the theme3 then he shows how art can improve upon nature, and reeurs to the
manifoldness ot' his subject, dwelling especially on the innumerable varieties of vineS.
without much relevancy he talks os trees indigenous to different countries, and is thence
drawn into an eulogy (vv. 136·176) of Italy, which he does not fit with any practical
application. The question of the aptitudes of various soils (vv. 177 soll.) is treated
more widely than the subject of the book requires, embracing the choice οἱ corn and
pasture land as well as of ground for planting trees. For the next 160 lines (vv. 259·
420) the poet seems to be thinking exclusively os the vine or of trees planted in the
‘ arbustum ’ as its supporters. He does not distinguish between the different modes os
rearing the vine, but appears to assume that the ‘arbustum’ will be adopted. He
speaks of the vine and its supporters almost indifferently‚ as objects more or less of the
same culture, so that, while keeping the former prominently before him, he feels
himself at liberty to use general language, or even to confine his language to the latter,
as medical—convenience or poetica] variety may suggest ς a manner of speaking which
renders this part of the book peculiarly difficult, at least to an unprofessional commen·
tator. The olive, which was put sorward prominently in the programme ot' the book,
is disposed of in a very few lines (vv. 420-425), as requiring hardly any culture. The
other fruit-trees (vv. 426·457) are dismissed even more briefly, and the remaining trees
receive a very hasty recommendation to the cultivator, backed with an assurance that
they are even more useful to man than the vine. In the celebrated digression (vv. 458
foll.) which concludes the book, the laborious aspect ot' a country life, elsewhere so
prominent, is kept out os sight, and we hear only of ease, enjoyment, and plenty. Its
interest as bearing on the tastes of the poet himself has been noticed in the general
Introduction to the Georgics.

The beauties of this book have always been admired, and deservedly se. They are
most conspicuous in the digressions 3 but the more strictly didactic part contains
innumerable felicities os expression, though it may be doubted whether in general
they do not obscure the practical meaning as much as they illustrate it—whether in
fact they do not constitute the strongest condemnation of that school of poetry of which
they are so illustnious an example. [The debt of Virgil to Lucretius is perhaps even
greater in this book than in the other Georgics: examples are quoted by Mr. Munro
on Lucr. 1 78, m 449.]

As in the case of Book 1, we can say nothing of the date. Vv. 171, 172 seem to
have been written just aster Actium ; but the passage to which they belong is precisely
one which may have been introduced aster the bulk of the poem was composed. [Vv.
497 foll„ 505 soll„ may allude to the events of 33-32 B.c.—H. N.]
