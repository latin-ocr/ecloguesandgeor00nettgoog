GEORGICON LIB. IV.

et liquida et durum Bacchi domitura saporem.
At cum incerta volant caeloque examina ludunt,
contemnuntque favos et frigida tecta relincunt,

instabilis animos ludo prohibebis inani.

nec magnus prohibere labor: tu regibus alas
eripe; non illis quisquam cunctantibus altum
ire iter aut castris audebit vellere signa.
invitent croceis halantes floribus horti,

et custos furum atque avium cum falce saligna

Hellespontiaci servet tutela Priapi.
ipse thymum pinosque ferens de montibus altis

103-115. ‘If your bees are given to
fl ' far rather than working in the hive,

ip their chiei's win There should be
a gardeu to attract t em3 do not grudge

them.'

103. ‘Incerta‚' vaguely, without an
object, as o to their issuing forth to
collect honey. So ‘ ludunt,' of expatiat-
ing idly in the air, as explained by v. 105.

‘ Caelo: ’ local abl„ see 1 6.

[‘ Exagmina’ Med. o ' inally, and so
Ribbeck: see v. 21.— {¹314

104. ‘Frigidaz ‘ op . to the warmth
im arted to the hive 'by their presence
(⁶ overe ’ v. 43) and their labour (⁴fervet
opus‚’ v. 169.

[⁴ Relincunt ' Med. ‘ relinqunt ’ Pal.
‘relinquent’ fragm. Vat.—H. N .]

105. ‘ Instabilis animos,' like κουφονόων
ὀρνίθων, Soph. Ant. 343, where there seems
amixture ot moral and physical lightness.
Comp. also Aristoph. Birds 169, ἅνθρωπος
ὅρνις ἀστάθμητος, πετόμενος, 'Aricinam-oc,
οὐδὲν οὐδέποτ’ ἄν ταύτῷ μενων.

[⁸ Prohibebis ' imperative, E. x 31, etc.]

106. ‘Tu ’ gives force to the precept,
as 11 2413 111 163. In 11 241, as here,
there may be a contrast between human
labour and nature, ‘do you act thus:

bees srom flying off. Didymus (Geop.
xv 4) and Pliny (xl 54) speak merely of
clipping the wings‚ and· this is all that
Virg. need have meant, though Col. (lx
10) says ‘ spoliandus est alis)

107. ‘Altum,' like ‘caelo ludunt,' as
opp. to flying near the flowers. The

rhythm and language of this and the next
line echo 1 456, 457, ‘ Non illa quisquam
¹¹¹² 110350555„232u53„532‚‚neque ² ‘⁶¹¹²
miro? ‘ Vellere signa ' [pluck up the stan·
dard in the camp, 1.e. move. So Cic. De
Div. 1 77 ‘ signa convelli iussit,’ Liv. 111
l 1 1 ‘ vellerent signa.’]

109. Another wa os keeping bees near

the hive is to provi e a garden.
‘ Croceis ε ’ coloured [and rfumed]

flowerS, the deifer the indes. ( eightley.)

110. ‘ Let there be a rden, placed
under the guardianship of iapu5‚' seems
to mean, ⁸ Let there be a regular garden,
complete iu its appointments) Thefollow-
ing verses also direct that no labour is to
be spared. At the same time the bees are
meant to share in the protectior) extended
to the garden 3 thieves might have an eye
to the honey as well as to the fruit, and
birds might carry off the bees, v, 16.

‘ Custos ' here with a gen. of the thing
guarded against, like φυλακὴ κακοῦ. [The
construction appears to be unique, but is
quite intelligible.]

⁸ Falx sah a ’ carried in the hand of
the figure. ed. a m. p. has ‘ frugum.'

111. ‘ Hellespontiaci ε ’ comp. Catull-
iragm. ii (Ellis).

‘ Hunc lucum tibi dedico consecroque,
Priape,

Qua domus tua Lampsaci est, quaque
silva, Priape,

Nam te praecipue in suis urbibus colit ora

Hellespontia, ceteris ostreosior oris.'

[‘ Tutela Priapi ’= ‘tutor Priapus’]

112. ‘ Ipse ’ emphasizes the importance
of the direction. It also enforces, like
other passageS, the necessity of personal
labour, and the dignity arising from it.
