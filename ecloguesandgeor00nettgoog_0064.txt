lx THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

that terrae was nom. pl, not (as Donatus took it three centuries after-
wards) the gen. sing„ · in Aen. lx 386 he took imprudens as= ignorans
se evasisse. Other explanations of his appear more ingenious than
sound: as, for instance, when' m x 188 he took crimen vestrum to mean
causa vestrae mutationis .· or when in Aen. 11 305 he explained montano
flumine as = magnoflumine: or in Aen. ιν 146 picti Agathyrsi as stigmosi,
tattooed, an opinion from which Servius dissents: or in lx 678 armati
ferro as :sema corda habentes. Some of his notes on points os inter·
pretation appear to have come from Verrius Flaccus Thus he says on
Aen. x 6 (see Scholia Veronensia) that quianam is an archaic word.
ServiuS, whose note does not name Asper but is probably indebted to
him, quotes quianam from Ennius. Now this was also the case with
Verrius Flaccus' note on the word (FestuS, p. 2 5 7) though the instances
quoted by Festus and Servius are not identical. So also perhaps with
the note on sinum lactis in the Verona scholia on Ecl.v11 33 ‘Aspen
Sinum est vas vinarium, ut Cicero significat, non, ut quidam, lactarium.

Plautus in Curculione (1 i 75), Cedo pstere sinum. Et respondetur.
Quasi tu lagoenam dicas in qua Chium vinum solet esse. Sinus ergo vas
patulum . . . e sinus vocitatum . ..Varro de Vita Populi Romani
lib. 1 lepictam vas dicebant ubi erat vinum. in mensa positum, aut galeola
aut sino. Tria enim haec similia sunt, pro quibus nunc acratophoron
ponitur.’ With this note, which is also given in Servius (Dan.) without
acknowledgmenss must be compared that in Nonius p. 547. Sinum et
galeolas, vasa sinuosa. Vergilius m Bucolicis (v11 3 3) sinum lactiS, et
haec te liba, Priape, quotannis Expectare sat est.’ Varro de Vita Populi
Romani lib.1‘ubi erat vinum in mensa positum aut galeola aut sino!

Leptkta, vas aheneum. Varro de Vita Populi Romani lib. 1 ‘ut sere
habent aheneum (? alii) qui venditant oleum. Lepistac etiamnunc
Sabinorum sanis pauperioribus plerisque aut fictiles sunt aut ahenae!
Now the note on leptkta probably comes from Verrius Flaccus», for
PauluS, p. 1 15, sayS, ‘ lepista genus vasis aquarii ': and many other
notes in the fifteenth book of Nonius, De genere vasorum vel poculorum,

can be shown to have been derived from that author: those namely on
aula ,pelvis‚ patella, cymbia, orca, catinus, calpar, armillum, and creterme.
(Compare PauluS, pp. 23, 247, 248, 51, 180, 169, 65, 53.)

On Aen. v11 485, Asper, as quoted in the Verona scholia, remarks:

‘nomen Tyrrhi ab historicis hauxit—Tyrrhum enim aiunt fuisse pastorem
aput quem Lavinia delituit tum cum Ascanium timens fugit in silvas-
Hic Latini vilicus traditur fuisse.' This note Ribbeck (Prol. p. 134)
thinks may have come from Cato.

Notes os Asper on the character of Mezentius as contemptor mavum,
and on the Potitii and Pinarii, are quoted by Macrobius Sat. 111 v 9. Of
the first of these Servius has nothing, but os the second he has 3 great
deal in his comment on Aen. vm 270.

I will conclude by giving a list of the notes which are expressly
assigned to Asper by the Verona scholia, or PhilargyriuS, but which are
given by ServiuS, sometimes in an abridged form, without acknowledg·
ment of their source. These are, so far as I have 'been able to
ascertain, that on sinum lactis, Ecl. vu 33 3 on infilius Ulixi, Aen. 111
