22 Bucom'CA.

The date os the fourth Eclogue is fixed by that of Pollio's con-
sulship (40 B.C.), the eighth may with almost equal certainty be
assigned to 39, and the tenth has with much probability been
referred to 3 7. The date of the seventh is unknown, and that of
the sixth quite uncertain, though it is often connected with the
third and ninth and thought to be a little later than them.

Suetonius (Vita Vergilii, 25), and aster him ServiuS, say that
Virgil wrote the Eclogues in three years: a statement probably
based on the fact that the first Eclogue may be assigned to 40,
and the last to 37 B.C.¹

Schaper (Quaestiones Vergilianae, i), followed by Baehrens,
believes that the fourth, sixth, and tenth Eclogues were written
in the year 27-2 5 B.C. and inserted by Virgil in a second edition
of the Bucolica. Ι agree with Ribbeck in thinking that there are
no solid grounds for this hypothesis. There is no hint in
Suetonius or any other ancient authority² of a second edition of
the Eclogues The fourth Eclogue was referred by all the ancient
commentators to the consulship of Pollio, the name of Pollio
stands in the text, and can only be removed by violence. There
is nothing again, either in the style or the matter of the sixth or
tenth EclogueS, which can fairly be held to justify so strange a
breach with an excellent historical tradition.³—H. N.

¹ [Denticke (J ahresbericht 1896, 356) also doubts the three yearS. He observes
that the Eclogues are said to have been written in 3 yearS, the Georgics in 7 (3 ÷ 4),
and the Aeneid in 11 (7 -1- 4), and suspects this symmetry.]

² Servius, in his Life, sayS, it is true, ‘carmen Bucolicum . . . . eum constat
triennio scripsisse et emendasse.’ But the word emendasse (used also by Servius of
the Georgics) means only that Virgil put the finishing touch to the Eclogues, as he
was prevented by death from doing to the Aeneid.

³ [Ribbeck, in the presace to his last edition (Lipsiae, 1895), gives B.C. 42·39 as
the dates within which the Eclogues were written; he assigns the first to the summer
of 41, the ninth to the autumn of the same year, the sixth a little later, the fourth to
40, theleighth to the early autumn of 39. Most recent writers agree more or less
with him, as indeed all must who accept the statements that virgil ‘ xxvln annos
natum bucolica edidisse ’ and ‘triennio scripsisse.’ M. Sonntag‚ Vergil als bukolischer
Dichter (Leipzig, 1891) has tried to show that the carrying out os the land confiscations
of Re. 41 lasted some years, and that the first Eclogue may be assigned to the spring
of B.C. 38: he supposes that six of the poems were written in 39, and 1, vl, nt, and x
added in 38 or 37. There is no real evidence sor these conclusions, and Deuticke,
Ribbeck, and other good critics very rightly reject them. Even the suggestion that
E. 1 can be put as late as 38 seems improbable, though Deuticke inclines to accept it.
Appian writes as if the settlement of the veterans in 41 B.C. had to be carried out at
once, and a delay of three years is incredibla]
