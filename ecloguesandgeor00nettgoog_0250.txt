slave should be turned out, and a spinster without a child fetched
in, and the watch-dog fastened up for sear of thieves. When
Orion and Sirius are in mid-heaven, let the grapes be gathered :
when the Pleiades angl Hyades and Orion set, it is time to think
of ploughing again. But it is a bad time for having a ship at sea,
if Perses should think os sailing, as well he may, seeing that his
father and Hesiod’s sailed from Cyme to Ascra, a bad dwelling-
place either in winter or summer, all that he might fly from

poverty. For himself, Hesiod owns that he has had no great '

experience in ships: he has had a single voyage from Aulis to
Euboea, when he went to Chalcis and won a tripod with ears there
as a singing-prize: still, the Muses have inspired him, and he
will give directions about this also, The best season for sailing
is at the end of summer, but the mariner must hasten back and

danger, though men persist in braving it, and it is terrible to die
at sea. From sailing he passes to marrying, and from marrying

precepts is about the lucky and unlucky days of the month,
which are enumerated with a fulness contrasting strangely with
Virgil’s brief notice of the subject. ‘ Different men,’ concludes
the old bard, ‘ praise different dayS, but few have any knowledge:
sometimes a day is a stepmother, sometimes a mother: where-
sore blessed and happy is he that has knowledge of all, and
works his work unblamed by the immortaIS, distinguishing

I have thought it worth while to give this sketch of Hesiod's
poem, endeavouring to preserve something of its colour as well
as its form, that it may be seen how far removed it stands in its
rude simplicity from the pomp and circumstance of later didactic
poetry, and how little Virgil understood of his author’s genius or
