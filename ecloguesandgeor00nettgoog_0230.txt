recommended by the whole tone os the
passage, ‘ Would 1 had been a peacesul
shepherd, living my lise and loving my
love Ξ but military madness has made me
a soldier, ancl my love has easily lest me.'
Heyne read ‘ te' from a conjecture of
Heumann, supposing that Lycoris had
gone after a soldier lover, leaving Gallus
to *Ρῦὃιξὲἓὲ 311)εοῖἵῖηὲ daeg& frequently
to contrast an actual state with a hypo·

thesis. Forb. comp. Tibull. 1 x 11 foll. ·

‘ T unc mihi vita soret . . . nuuc ad bella
trahor‚’ where the subject as well as the
expression is more or less similar.

46. ‘Tantum’ seems best taken as
523232? ²² ἑξ ἶὲῗῶἳῗὲ ἱέἱῖἓῖΐὺὲῗ 3}
a thing believed. ⁶ w0u1’d that 1 mi’ght
find myself unable to believe it l ’ Heyne
comp. T ibull. 111 iv 82, ‘ Aego ne possim
tanta videre mala l' ‘ Procul tantum ’
(v1 16 note) would be out of place here3
the harshness of separating the words
would be great, and ⁸ tantum ' with
‘ nives vides would be exceedingly weak.

Serv. says on this line that these verses
are really Gallus’ own, extracted from his
poems; but he does not say where the
extract begins or ends.

47. Humboldt (Cosmos, vol. ii, Sabine’s
trans.) instances the uniform language of
the Romans about the savageness and
&Plfizisslsssszziffiiffs ἓξ ἱῖξιῇξρίἕζέεξὲοζῗ
So there is nothi in the Prometheus to
show that Aeschy us felt with any dis·
tinctness the sublimity of the landscape,
on which a modern poet could hardly have
sailed to dwell.

⁸ Frigora ’ is in itself no more than cold
weather or winter, as in v. 65, but in
connexion with ‘ Rheni' it might imply
that the river was frozen. In that case,
‘ frigora laedant ’ in the next verse will be
the same as ‘ glacies secet aspera planta3‚'
m v. 49.

‘ Dura ε ’ the hardness of nature which

steeled Lycoris against Gallus’ love would
lead her to brave Alpine snows. Comp.
such passages as Hor. od. 1 iii 9 soll.

48. Voss comp. Prop. 1 viii 7, ‘Tu
pedibus teneris positas fulcire pruinas, Tu

tes insolitaS, Cynthia, ferre nives?

mm. comp. Ov. M. 1 508, ‘ue prona
cadaS, indignave laedi Crura secent sentes'
which seems to show that Virg. here is
expressing a caution rather than a wish.

50-61. ⁸ 1 will turn my poems into pas-
torals, and record my love on the barks os
trees; 1 will hunt with the nymphs and
titre shepherds, in the hope -a vain hope——

5ο. Gallus had translated Euphorion of
Chalcis, whose poems were chiefly m tho·
logical ancl os the Alexandrine sc ool.
He was popular in the time of Cicer0,
who complains (Tusc. 111 19) of his being
preferred to Ennius by the taste of the
day, and elsewhere (De Div. 11 64) speaks
os his obscuri , a common Alexandrian
vice, which, owever, seems to ,have
recommended him to Tiberius (Suet. T ib.
70). As he is said to have been imitated
also by Tibullus and PropertiuS, his elegiae
poems may have been those most in favour
at Rome: and these accordingly may
have been the poems which Gallus put
into Roman dress (possibly in his elegias
to Lycoris), and which he now pro es
to adapt to the pastoral model os heo-
critus. (For other conjectures see Heyne’s
Excursus.) How the adaptation was to
be made is not very easy to see, unless we
3¹33& :13¹3 ² hi}“¹2¹i,⁵ffe‘‡12⁵gs‘⁰in⁸p1??s¹{013i
phraseology‚ changing his actual circum-
stances into the accidents of a shepherd’s
life, as Virg. has done for him in this
Eclogue.
