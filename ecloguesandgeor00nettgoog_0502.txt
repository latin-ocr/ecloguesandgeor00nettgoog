P. VERGILI MARONIS

fata vocant, conditque natantia lumina somnus, qq&
iamque vale: feror ingenti circumdata nocte,
invalidasque tibi tendens, heu non tua, palmas!
dixit, et ex oculis subit0, ceu sumus in auras

commixtus tenuis, sugit diversa, neque illum,

prensantem nequiquam umbras et multa volentem
dicere, praeterea vidit3 nec portitor Orci

amplius obiectam passus transire paludem.

quid faceret Ρ quo se rapta bis coniuge ferret?

quo fletu ManiS, qua numina voce moveret?

496. ‘NatantialuminQ’A.v856. ‘Nant says (‘pa1us' = Styx), ‘mysticum ωε ε

ocu1i,’ Lucr. 111 480, of a drunken man.
497. ⁸ Ingenti circumdata nocte,’ a con-

dicitur enim bis eandem umbram evocari
non licere,' supposing the object of ‘pas-

trust to the light into which they were sus' to be Eurydice.

emerging, v. 490, as in ‘non tua' we

have another contrast to ⁴ Eurydicen ‘

suam.’ Virg. has been supposed to
imitate Eur. Phoen. 1453, urai χαίρετ’·
ἤδη γάρ με περιβάλλει σκότος.

498. ⁴ Invalidas palmas ε ’ ‘in umbrae

the disembodied spirit combine with it.

⁸ Fugit diversa, by another wa , like
⁴ quo diversus abis? ’ A. v 166. She was
flying back to night, and consequently
in a different direction from him. [Or
‘ fled afar.’—H. N.]

501. ⁴ Umbras :' [either (1) thedarkness
which Orpheus clutches in hope of ern·
bracing Eurydice, as Con. originally took
it, or (2) her shade‚ the 1. sor the sing. as
Α. ιν 571, v 87, as
second thoughts.]

⁸ Multa volentem dicere: ' A. 11 7903
see tv 390.

502. ‘ Praeterea,’ A. 1 49.

⁸ Portitor t ' Charon, A. v1 326 (note).

503. ‘Obiectam' like ‘obiecta . . .
flumina’ 111 253.

‘ Passus ε’ the object is probably Or·
pheus, who, as Keightley sayS, must have
attempted to cross the river again. Serv.

504. ‘Quid faceret ε’ Ε. 111 21 note.

505. The latter part of the line seems
merely to repeat the former, ‘ Manis '
being extended to include the powers
below as well as the shades subject to

them. There are no traces of a popular
government amon the shades. This

Greek Judges os the Dead, Pluto, etia}
‘ Numina ’ is elsewhere applied to the
Infernal Powers (A. vl 266, 324, vn 571).
There is no occasion, sor variety‘s sake, to
understand it here of the gods above, who
would not naturally have any jurisdiction
in the matter. Here again we may inser
that Orpheus made sotne fresh attempt,
though the lines may merelybe a soliloquy
ex essed in oratio obliqua.

om. reads ‘quos’ for ‘ qu0,' Rom.
and Med. ‘ quae’ for ‘ ua.’ [⁸ Moueoet ’
Med. originally.-—H. ἦ]

506. This verse has been thought out
of place, and is bracketed by Ribbeck.
But it really adds much to the beauty of
the passage, serving to complete the pic·
ture of hopelessness as presented to

' mind and to balance Eurydioe’s
fate with hir», described in the subsequent
lines. ‘ What should he do? even while
