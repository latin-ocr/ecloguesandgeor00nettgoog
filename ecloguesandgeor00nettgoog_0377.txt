weather. Taubm. quotes Cato v, who
lays down as ageneral rule ‘ Opera omnia
mature conficias face : nam res rustica
sic est: si unam rem sero feceris, opera
omnia sero feceris) On the other hand,
the more thoroughly ripe the grapeS, as
Keightley says, the better the wine.

409. ⁶ Sarmenta‚' prunings 01 1118 vine.
Festus p. 322 derives the word from an
ancient verb ‘sarpo,' to prune3 [and the
der. is generally accepted] In a second·
ary sense it isused simply for the branches
01 1118 vine. ‘ Devecta,' as in v. 207.

‘ Vallos,' the vine-poles. Varro, R. R.
1 8, ‘ Ibi dominus simulac vidit occipitium
vindemiatoris surcillas reducit hibernatum
in tecta, ut sine sumptu earum opera
altero anno uti possit.’ It would seem
at first sight that ‘vallos’ must refer to
espalier vines. But comp. vv. 358-361‚
where ‘ sudes ' is convertible with ⁶ vallos.'

410. ‘ Metit0‚’ of vines, like ‘segeS‚'
‘serere,' ‘semina,' Heyne. Comp. lv 231,
where ‘messis’ is used of collecting honey.
‘ Bis : ' in spring and autumn.

‘ Umbra may refer to the shade of the
elm or other supporting tree. Col. xv 27
however uses ‘ umbras compescere,' speak-
ing of the foliage of the vine.

411. ‘ Segetem‚' the vineyard, or the
vines ; ‘ obducunt ' favours the 10111181.

‘ Herbae ' must be used in a wide sense,
as in Cic. De Div. 1 34, ‘ Herbae asperae
et agrestes.‘ The weeding (‘runcatio ²)
appears to have taken place at the same
time as the pruning. Pal. has ‘inducunt.'

412. ‘ Uterque labor:' not the double
labour in spring and autumn, but the

double labour of ‘ pampinatio' and ‘ run-

see the point 01 1118 epigram. Here the
point is obviouS, the larger estate being

prima facie the best, and large estates
being only too common in Italy (Pliny
xvtu 35). ‘Laudato' does not itself
mean ι1818110;’ is it did, there would be
no force in the antithesis Still the same
feeling is at the root of this 1158 01 1118
word and that of ἐπαινεῖν for to decline,
the feeling, namely, which appears in our
use 01 1118 word ⁴ compliment.' The
connexion here is that, as the work is
exacfing, a small estate is better than a
large one. [Serv. says the same precept
was given by Cato to his som—H. N.]
Col. 1 3, ἐξ 8 foll„ after quoting these
words of Virg., says, ‘Quippe acutissi-
mam gentem Poenos dixisse convenit,
imbecilliorem agrum quam agricolam esse
debere, quoniam, cum sit colluctandum
cum eo, si fundus praevaleat, adlidi domi·
num. Nec dubium quin minus reddat
laxus ager non recte 81111115, quam angus·
tus eximie.’ He speaks of the old Roman
feeling against dividing conquered lands
among a few, ‘ nec magis quia superbum
videbatur tantum loci detinere, quam quia
flagitiosum, quos hostis profugiendo deso·
lasset agr05, novo more civem Romanum
supra vires patrimonii possidendodeserere ; ’
and contrasts the modern practice, ‘ prae-
potentium, qui possident finis gentium,
quos ne circumire equis quidem valent,
sed proculcandos pecudibus, et vastandos
ac populandos feris derelinquunt, aut occu·
patos nexu civium et ergastulis tenent-²

413. ‘Rusci,‘ butchers' broom. But·
chers' broom, reeds, and willows are to
be cut 101· tying up the vine.

415. ‘Salictiz' comp. 1 265, ‘ Aut
Amerina parat lentae retinacula viti.’
‘Inculti' would seem to show that the
‘ cura'can be onlythat 01 cutting them : but
they also required pruning, Pliny xvu 142.

416. ‘Reponunt’= ‘reponisinunt.' The
language passes from precept to the liveli-
ness of narrative. [‘Victae' Pal. and
originally Med.—H. N .] ·
