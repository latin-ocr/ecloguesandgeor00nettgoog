52. ‘ Numerum ’ is understood by Heyne
and some later editors of the counting of
the sheep, the rospect of which does not
deter the wolf rom devouring them. The
old interpretation seems simpler ; the wolf
does not sear the multitude of the sheep.
Thus the notion is that of Juvenal’s ‘de-
fendit numerus,’ and Horace’s ‘nos nu·
merus sumus,’ ‘ a mere set of θεὼ-(53

53-56. ‘ Cor. It is the fruit season, and
all is luxuriant : but the absence os Alexis
would blight all.'

53. ‘Stant’ is more than ‘sunt,' by
which Heyne explains it: but it merely
gives the picture.

The non-elision of ‘ iuniperi’ and ‘cas-
taneae ' is a metrical variet borrowed by
Virg. from the Greeks. he e is
imitated from Theocr. vul 41 foll.

54. Perhaps from Theocr. vu 144 fon.

‘Quaque,' the conjecture of Heius„
Gronovius, and Bentley for ‘ quaeque‚’ has
been adopted by many editorS, including
Heyne and Wagn., and is found in two
of Ribbeck’s cursives. But Lachm. on
Lucr. η 371 has shown from other pas-
sages that ‘ quaeque ' here would be equally
correct, and Wagn. Lect- Verg. pp. 368
foll„ does not break down his case. The
construction is doubtless to be explained
by attraction. Another suggestion is to
make ‘ sua ' the abl. sing. pronounced
monosyllabically, as in Enn. and Lucr.;
but to this Wagn. replies with force that
it is most stra e that Virg. should have
preferred an arc aism os this kind when a
more obvious expression was close at hand.

55. ‘Alexis’ is doubtless introduced
with a reference to E. 11 (compare the
mention of mountains in 11 5), but as
Corydon does not always adhere to his
own character (see v. 30), we need not
suppose that he is always speaking os

those whom he has himself loved. [⁸ For-
monsus' Pal. originall .—H. N. See v, 38.]

56. The general dy ought would affect
even the riverS, which are the natural re·
source when there is no rain. Pal. has

57. All that can be said against Thyrsis ¹
here is that he dwells more on unpleasing¹
objects than Corydon: but this was forced
on him by the subject of his picture, and
he makes what he can of the anticipated
contrast‚ vv. 59, 60.

‘ Vitio‚’ disease, a sense more common
in tHe cognate ‘vitiosus ’ and ‘ vitiare: '
‘ Dira lues quondam Latias vitiaverat
auraS,' Ov. M. xv 626. Virg. may be
referring to Lucr. vl 1090 foll„ where
diseased states of the air are treated as
causes ospestilence. Comp. ‘ morbo caeli '
G. 111478, ‘ corrupto caeli tractu ’ A. 111 1 38.

59. ‘ Nemus omne' may refer to the
pLantations, or perhaps, as vines have just

en spoken of, to the ‘ arbustum,' which
appears to be its sense, G. 11 308, 401.
[Med. originally had ‘ videbit.’—H. Ν.]

GTT324, ‘caeli minsa, 1 129, which is
the same picture, the whole sky appearigg
to pour down, though without the add
personification. ‘ Iuppiter' is used os the
air, G. 1418, 11 419.

61-64. ‘ Cor. Each god has his favourite
treet but Phyllis is fond of the hazel‚ so
that is the tree for me.’
