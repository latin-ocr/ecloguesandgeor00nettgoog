xxviii LIFE OF VIRGIL.

which in themselves seemed liseless and trivia] sounded well when he
recited them.

Virgil's father must, if we may trust the little poem in the Catalepton
addressed to the villa os Siron,¹ have been alive at the time of the con·
fiscations of 41 nc. He was blind at the time of his death.² Virgil
had two brotherS, Silo and Flaccus· Silo died in his boyhood; FlaccuS,
who died in riper years, is said by Suetonius to have been the Daphnis
of the fifth Eclogue.⁸ Virgil's mother, Magia, survived her husband and
married again. A son, named Valerius ProculuS, was the issue os this
union.

Virgil seems to have been much beloved by his friends, among whom
perhaps the most intimate were Horace, Quintilius Varus, Varius, and
Tucca.⁴ Horace describes ³ Virgil and Varius, whom he constantly
mentions together, as most transparent and lovable souIS.

Owing to the generosity of his friends Virgil enj0yed a fortune os
nearly A 100,ooo. 1t is interesting to know that when Augustus offered
him the property of an exiled citizen, whose name has not been pre·
served, he could not bring himself to accept it. He was seldom at
Rome, though he had a house there near the gardens of Maecenas, and
spent most of his time in Sicily or Campania!⁵ Half of his property
he left to his half-brother Valerius Proculus, a quarter to Augustus, a
twelfth part to Maecenas, and the rest to Varius and Tucca. His remains

were taken to Naples and buried in a tomb on the road to Puteoli, with
the epitaph—

‘ Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc
Parthenope ε cecini pascua, rura, duces.' '¹

¹ Catal. vm. ‘ Villula quae Sironis eras et pauper agelle,
verum illi domino tu quoque deliciae,
me tibi et hos una mecum, quos semper amavi,
si quid de patria tristius audier0,
commendO, in primisque patrem ε tu nunc eris illi
Mantua quod suerat quodque Cremona prius?
