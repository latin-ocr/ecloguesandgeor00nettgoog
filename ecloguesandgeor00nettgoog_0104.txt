c THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

be prepared sor the conclusion at which I am inclined to arrive, that a
large body of Virgilian learning had accumulated by the end of the
fourth century A.n.‚ the greater and by far the most valuable part of
which was at least as old as the ,age of Trajan, and much even older ;
and that from these materials it was that the author or authors of the
Verona scholia, Philargyrius, Macrobius, Servius, and the authorities
followed by the Berne scholia, drew their information independently of
each other. This hypothesis will I hope be found to account for the
considerable number os instances in which they agree, and the number,
perhaps hardly less considerable, in which they exhibit independence or

divergence.
