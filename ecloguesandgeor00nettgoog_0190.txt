82 P. VERGILI MARON IS

utque viro Phoebi chorus adsurrexerit omnis;

ut Linus haec illi, divino carmine pastor,

floribus atque apio crinis ornatus amar0,

dixerit: ‘ Hos tibi dant calamoS, en accipe, Musae,
Ascraeo quos ante seni, quibus ille solebat 70
cantando rigidas deducere montibus ornos

his tibi Grynaei nemoris dicatur orig0,

quid loquar, aut Scyllam Nisi, quam fama secuta est

67. ‘Ut' comes after ‘ut . . . utque,’
as ‘ dum ’ after ‘ dum . . . dumque,’ v 77,
comp. by Wund. ‘ Divino carmine ’ with
‘ pastor,’ ex ressing the combination of
attributes which made Linus an ap ro·
priate hero of pastoral try. T ere
seems no evidence that inus was sup-
posed ever to have been a shepherd‚ but it
was natural for a pastoral poet to conceive
of him as such.

68. Parsle was a favourite material
for gar an s used by a shepherd in Theocr.
111 22 to form a crown for his love, worn
commonly at feasts (Hor. od. 1 xxxvi
16, ete), and given as a prize in the
Nemean games. There seems to be no
reason for its use here, beyond its natural
appropriateness: the epithet ‘ amarum'
too appears to be ‘simply descriptive.
Mlartyn takes ⁸ apium’ to be smallage or
ce eff.

70. ‘ Senex ¹ is similarly applied to
Lucilius Hor. S. 11 i 34, to Accius
and Pacuvius, id. Ep. 11 i 56, and to
Aristophanes Pers. 1 124. [Con. thought
it denoted antiquity: more probably it
indicates the venerable old age which
Greeks and Romans generally associated
with poets.]

71. The same result is ascribed to
magic, A. ιν 491. See on vm 3. It
does not seem to have been a traditional
characteristic of the effect of Hesiod’s

neater,gbut the difference is not great,
being only that in the one case we have
to supply ‘narraverit,' in the other ‘ut
narraverit ¹ (‘ Quid loquar, aut ut narrave-
rit Scyllam, aut ut mutatos‚' etc.). Jahn’s
construction of ‘Scyllam' with ‘loquar’
is objectionable; it involves an awkward
confusion between the narrative os Virg.

and leaves the words ‘ quam sama secuta
est ’ to form a tame and unmeaning paren-
thesis. On the other hand, Virg3is fond
of using ‘gama est' or some eqmvalent,
such as ‘ volat,’ A. 111 121, ‘ occupat
auris,’ ib. 294, with an infinitive clause,
so that ‘ fama secuta est ' may easily be
resolved into ⁴ fama est apud posteros!
