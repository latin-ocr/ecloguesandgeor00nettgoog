contemptible. Under the reign of Daphnis the wolf is to spare
the sheep: in the youth of the new-born ruler of the earth the
oak is to distil honey: Pollio and his admirer are to dwell in a
dream-land where spices grow on the bramble: yet it is in
images like these that Damon hurls his dying scorn at the world
where he has been robbed of his love. What can be more sig-
nificant than the apparently casual epithet arguta, applied in the
very first line of the seventh Eclogue to the tree under which
Corydon and Thyrsis are about to sing? Or let us take the
passage which serves as a comment on that epithet, the lines on
Maenalus in Damon’s song. Lucretius,¹ in his account of the
origin os society and civilization, tells us that pastoral music ·
must have been in the first instance an imitation of the sound of
the wind among the reeds: but the thought gains ‘indefinitely ξ
when it is localized and transferred to MaenaluS, ‘ whose forests ἰ
are ever tuneful and his pines ever vocal, who is ever listening to ἱ
the loves of shepherdS, and to Pan, the first who would not have
the reeds left unemployed.’ The personification of the mountain f
gives both definiteness and majesty to the conception : the very j
fact that the connexion between vocal woods and shepherds' Ι
songs is hinted rather than expressed is an advantage even ἱ
philosophically: and the mention of Pan supplies that mytho· Ι
logical framework to which the theories of the ancients on the
history of man primeval owe so much, not only of beauty, but os
substance. A minute analysis of the language of the Eclogues
is in truth a school of poetical criticism3 and though the subtilty
and complexity of the images involved may induce a practice of
over—refining on the part of the inquirer, yet experience‚ Ι think,
will show that the danger of giving Virgil credit for more than
he had in his mind is far less than would be supposed by an
ordinary reader.

There seems no reason to doubt that the order in which the
Eclogues now stand is that in which Virgil himself arranged
them, whatever bearing that may have on the question of their
relative dateS. The last line of the fourth GeorgiC‚ as Wagner
remarkS, even without the support of a similar notice by Ovid,
establishes the fact that the first Eclogue was intended to stand
