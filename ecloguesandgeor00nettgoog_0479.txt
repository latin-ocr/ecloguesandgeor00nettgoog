‘Coloratisx' as we talk of men of
colour, as Keightley remarks. ovid
Am. 1 xiv 6 applies the epithet to the
Seres. [Cic. de Or. 11 60 ‘cum in sole
ambulem, ficri ut colorer,’ Orator 42,
etc.

‘ponit,' derived from the phrase ‘iacere
fundamentum‚’ [Non. p. 327, and] Serv.
‘ Certam salutem’ then is a condensed ex·
pression for ‘ spem certae salutis?

Med. a m. p. has ‘certe' [Pal. and
Rom. ‘iacet.']

introduced here aster the legend account-
ing for it has been promised and before it
has been given, especially as the close of
that legend afterwards contains the same
recept in two forms. Herc again we

The precept itself is given in detail by
Florentinus (Geop. xv 2), who professes
to follow Democritus and Varro. On
this first head he says that the chamber,
οἶκος. should be ten cubita high and
broad, and four square, with oue door
aud four windows, one on each side. Virg.
evidentl intends to give similar direc-
tions; t his language is not easily
explicable. He says that a suitable spot
is to be chosen, narrow and confined—an
injunction which Florentinus seems to

have thought unnecessary, and which ap-

it was built in an open space or in a bole.
Thus he can scarcely mean more than that
a chamber is to be built of sufficient
smaliness for the purpose.

‘Ipsos contractus ad usust’ it seems
open to us to interpret either (1) as is ‘ad
usus ’ = ‘in usus ’ (which is actually found
in Pal. and the first reading of Med., and
me& samaa& suffla
“ad ' expressed the standard to which the
reduction was to be made, ‘ narrowed
down’ (we might say) ‘to the bare oeca-
siou.’ ‘ Ad usus ’ is found nowhere else·
in Virg.: for ‘in usum' or ‘usus’ see
111 313 and A. ιν 647, ‘non hos quaesi·
tum munus in usus!

296. ‘ Imbrices,' semi-cylindrical tiles
coveriug the lines of junction between
the tows of flat tiles (⁴ tegulae ’) on the
roos. ‘Augusti imbrice tecti ’ here seems

a poetical amplification for ⁴ angusto ·

remark that ⁸ imbrex‚’ though generally
masc. ‚ is properly feminine, quoting Plaut.

imbrice tecti ’ ?—H. N.]

too direct light, which would intersere

is to be done, as Mr. Long remarks», Virg.
does not explain.

Mr. Yonge takes ‘a ventis ’ away from
the winds‚ as 111 302, and supposes that
the windows are to look N.E.‚ S.E.,
N.W., S.w., so that at noon the sun
would strike a window obliquely. [The
words of themselves might also mean
‘ facing the four winds.' The four vinds,
as Serv. says, are Eurus, Zephyrus, Boreas
and Notus (Homer), though there appears
to be no other ε in Greek or Latin
in which ⁵ four winds ' are mentioned as
the four points of the compass. Nor is
there anything of the sort in art. η

virgil means that the windows are to
admit very little light or air ε see 303 note.
This device would help putrefaction.]
