VIRGIL AND HIS ANCIENT CRITICS. xxxv

should be observed, throw fresh light on the relation of the Servius of
the Saturnalia to the real ServiuS, who has the remark on vexare (Ecl. v1
75 ¹) m a shorter form, and without any mention of objections3 while ιιι
his note on inlaudatus (Georg. ιιι 4) he takes no account of the discus-
sion oerried on in Gellius and Macrobius but simply explains the word
as = qm laudan· non debeat. With these cn'ticisms compare Servius on
Aen. vm 731, ‘ hunc versum notant critici quasi superfluo et inuti-
liter additum, nec convenientem gravitati eius, namque est magis
neotericus 3' Aen. xi 53, ‘ hoc quidam ἀνέκδοτον (avemus-‹51› ?) et vulgare
accipiunt 3 sed decenter ad exprimendum patris adfectum nunc ad
patrem redit.'

ΙΙΙ.

Ι now come to consider some of the criticisms made upon Virgil's
management of his story in the Aeneid. Macrobius 1 xxiv 2 speaks of
‘ multa pudenda . . . in dispositione operis·³

In the Ars Poetica (143 foll.) Horace lays down the principle that the
Homeric order of narrative (as distinguished, for instance, we may sup-

pose him to mean, from that of Apollonius Rhodius) is that which an epic
poet ought to follow:

‘Non furnum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem
ogi,tat ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat,

Antiphaten cyllarnque et cum Cyclopeagn Charybdim,
nec reditum Diomedis ab interitu Me

nec gemino bellum Troianum orditur ab ov03
semper ad eventum festinat, et in medias res
non secus ac notas auditorem rapit, ’.etc

I am inclined to think that this passage again is intended as a defence
os Virgil. At any rate, the point in question is treated by the early com·
mentatorS, and in his reply to the obtrectatores Vergilii we know that
Asconius set himself in particular to answer criticisms circa lu‘ston‘am,

albich wotuld, I suppose, include unfavourable remarks on the order of
e narra ive.

That such remarks had been made appears clearly from ServiuS, Aen.
p. 4 (Thilo) : ‘ ordo quoque manifestus est, licet quidem dicant secundum
(librum) primum esse, tertium secundum, et primum tertium . . .
nescientes hanc esse artem poeticam, ut a mediis incipientes per narra·
tionem prima reddamus. ² And on Aen. ι 34, ‘ ut Homerus omisit initia
belli Troiani, sic hic non ab initio coepit erroris! Again, with regard to
the whole plan of the Aeneid, which was intended by Virgil to include
both an Iliad a13d an Odyssey,‘ prius de erroribus Aeneae dicit, post de
bello' (Aen 1 1

Now these remarks are no more than a condensation of the passage
assigned to Eustathius ιιι the fifth book of the Saturnalia (ιι 6), ‘Aeneis
ipsa nonne ab Homero mutuata est errorem primum ex Odyssea, deinde
ex Iliade pugnas? quin operis ordinem necessario rerum ordo mutavit,

G lii'l'he 6Lemovicensis here adds the same illustrations of vexare as are given in
