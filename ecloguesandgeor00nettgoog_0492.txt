Ρ. VERGILI MARON IS

ipsa ego te, medios cum sol accenderit aestus,

cum sitiunt herbae, et pecori iam gratior umbra est,
in secreta senis ducam, quo sessus ab undis

se recipit, facile ut somno adgrediare iacentem.
verum ubi correptum manibus vinclisque tenebiS, 403
tum variae eludent species atque ora ferarum.

fiet enim subito sus horridu3‚ atraque tigris,
squamosusque draco, et fulva cervice leaena3

aut acrem flammae sonitum dabit, atque ita vinclis

excidet, aut in aquas tenuis dilapsus abibit.

as such things are not effected arbitrasily.
For ‘vincula tende ’ see A. 11 236 note.

‘Circum haec'seems to give asott of
physieal image, combined with ‘ frangen-
tur) ‘Against these barriers his craft
will break! Join ‘inanes ’ with ‘ fran-
gentur,’ proleptic.

Pal. and Rom. have ‘ franguntur,’ [and
Rom. has ‘ dolis.'—H. N.]

401. In Od. ιν 407 Eidothea promises
to conduct Ulysses to Proteus ἅμ ἠοῖ φαι-
νομένηφιν. [‘Accenderet' Pal.-—H. N J

402. ⁸ Cum sitiunt,’ etc„ is not co-ordi·
nate with ‘ cum accenderit,' but defines
and explains it, as if Virg. had said ⁴ simul
ac venerit tempus curn sitiunt) The clause
does not seem very appropriate, being in·
tended apparently to speak of the habits
ott: land cattle as if they held equally good
0 seals.

403. ‘ Secreta‚’ retreat, like ‘secreta
Sibyllae ’ A. v1 ro, ‘Aeneae secreta ’ vm
463. Proteus is supposed to sleep at mid·
day, like Silenus (E. vl 14) or Pan
(Theocr. 1 17, Nemes. Ecl. 111 3), as if
they were earthly shepherds. Δὲξεπιι ἐν
μέσσῃσι, νομεὺς ὃς πώεσι μήλων, Od. lv 41 3.

405. ⁸ Manibus vinclisque 'z Homer
makes no mention of setters, speaking
merely os manual restraint, μιλέτω κάρτος

2ιὲ31, τε . . ἀστεμφέως ἐχέμεν μᾶλλόν τε

μφὶ δὲ χεῖρας βαλλομεν.

406. ‘ Tum variae inludent pestes,’
1 181. Rom. has ‘ludent,' a natural
error.

407. In Hom. the transformations of
Proteus are summed up hastily by Eido-
thea, enumerated in greater detail by
Menelaus when they actually occur z in
Virg. the manners of description are re·
versed. There is nothing unnatural in
either course: Menelaus, in speaking os
what he had actually gone through, would

410

naturally be ‘culan Virgilhas no such
reason sor ο etailing what actually ha

πςπππεμ, &mmmmm
cision of detail especially suited to Cy·
ἓξὲξ ξνρῑξὲεννοιιὶᾱ wdmrggtgoknow all that
was hkely to hapgen.

‘Sus horridus: ‘hmemAroedhem’
Lucr. v 25, the ‘bristled boar' ot* Gray.
Hom. has μέγας σῦς.

⁸ Atra,’ which is designated by Heyne
:affl eadwi πεππ
are, 1 believe, black tigers, but V‘ . is not
likely to have thought of them. omer’s
beust is πάρδαλις.

”498 ἀλλ’ ἢτοι πρῶπστα λέων γένετ’
ἠυγενεως, od. lv ‚4S6· The lioness,
Wagn. remarks, has no mane, so that
Virg. in his love of poetical variety has
gone near to an error in natura] history,
besides the awkwardness of turning a god
into a female animal. Val. Fl. 111 740
talks of a lioness’ mane. [Rom. has
‘ leaenae.’—H. N.]

,409. θεσπιδαὲς πῦρ is mentioned by
Eidothea among the shapee which her
father assumes, but is not found among
those enumerated by Menelaus.

Med. has ‘sonitum flammae ς ’ but the
separation of adj. and subet. is more Vir·
gi ian.

410. ‘In aquas abibit‚' like ‘fructus
praediorum abeunt in sumptus,’ Cic. Au.
1(ῗὶ &gisough the image here seems purely
p ysi .

⁴ Tenuis,' 111 335. The Homerie epi·
thet is ὑγρόν.

·The St. Gall palimpsest has ‘elahsoe,'
[Pal. ‘dilabsus.’·-H. N.] Med. originally
had ‘habebit ς’ in A. v 156 ‘habet’ and
‘abit ' are confused in the MSS.
