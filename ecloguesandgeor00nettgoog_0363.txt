GEORGICON

ΜΒ. 11. 255

non animum modo uti pascat prospectus inanem, 285
sed quia non aliter vires dabit omnibus aequas
terra, neque in vacuum poterunt se extendere rami.

Forsitan et scrobibus quae sint fastigia quaeras,
ausim vel tenui vitem committere sulco,

altior ac penitus terrae defigitur arb03‚

regularly expressed apodosis; and in the
present passage it matters nothing, so far
as sense is concerned, whether we take
one from the preceding or following lines.

‘ Viarum' may be taken with ⁸ omnia'
or with ‘paribus numeris;' the order of
the words points to the latter.

‘ Paribus numeris viarum ’ probably ==
‘ pares et numerosae viae,' equal and
regular avenueS. Comp. ‘ numeroso
horto,’ Col. x 6. If the order is that of
the ‘ quincunx ’ all the avenues cannot be
equal, but the corresponding ones may.
Varro 1 vii 2, ‘ Si sata suntin quincuncem
propter ordines atque intervalla modica.’
Quint. vn! 3, ἓ 9, ‘ Quid enim illo quin-
cunce speciosiuS, qui, in quamcunque
partem spectaveriS, rectus est? Sed pro·
tinus in id quoque prodest, ut terrae
sucum aequaliter trahant.' Pliny xvn 78,
‘ In disponendis arboribus arbustisque ac
vineis quincuncialis ordinum ratio vulgata
et necessaria, non perflatu modo utilis,
verum et aspectu grata, quoquo modo
intueare in ordinem se porrigente versu.'

[ι Demensa’ Med. originally.-H. N.]

285. ‘ Inanem ' seems to be transferred
from ‘ prospectus' to ‘ animus? Comp.
‘animum pictura pascit inani,’ A. 1 463.
NVe may then take ‘ inanem ’ closely with
‘ pascat‚’ as Mr. Blackburn suggestS‚ seed
unsubstantially‚ i.e. without a view to
utility‚ not unlike ‘ pinguis pascere oves ²
E. vi

287.4‘ Because otherwise the boughs
will have no empty space wherein to
spread themselves. Ribbeck reads ‘ po·
terunt extendere ² (Rom. Pal.) ς but ‘ se '
is found in Med„ Ver. fragm„ and Gud.

288-297. ‘ The trench for the vine may
be shallow ς that for its supporter must be
dee r.’

agg. ‘Fastigium' is used of the slope
of a trench, Caesar, B. G. vn 73, ‘ Ante
hos obliquis ordinibus in quincuncem dis-

ositis scrobes trium in altitudinem pedum
ibdiebantur, paullatim angustiore ad in-
fimum fastigio ; ’ ‘fastigate’ is used of
a slope opposed to a perpendicular, ib. ιν
17. Virg. evidently intends us to think of

290

depth, which would depend on the length
and inclination of the slope. [Non. p.
gratensi? §tw-3:20¹ “3235“oe
Η. Ν.] In Varro 1 xiv 2, fossa ita idonea
si . . . fastigium habet ut [aqua?] exeat
e fund0,’ it appears to mean the fall of a
drain: Id. ib. xx 5, ‘ agricolae hoc spectan-
dum quo fastigio sit funduS‚' it seems to be
for the level of the ground. It would be
easy to classify these meanings and connect
them with those which contain the parallel
notion of height ; but we seem not to
have the starting-point of a plausible ety-
mology. [‘ Forsitam' Rom—H. N.]
289. ‘Sulcus’ is clearly distinguished
from ‘ scrobs ' in the agricultural writers ς
from Pallad. 11 10, Pliny xvir 139, and
Col. Arb. lv, it would appear that the
‘ sulcus ' is characterized by length.
Virg. ‚ however, obviously intends no such
distinction. As to the exact depth of the
‘ scrobes ' or ‘ sulci ' writers seem to vary:
Pliny xvir 80 soll„ Cal. 1v 1, v 6, etc.
Much depended‚ as Col. vu 13 remarks»,
on the particular soil. It would seem
however (Col. v 5 and v 6) that vines
were planted less deeply in an ‘ arbustum ’
than in another vineyard, though the lan-
guage of these passages is scarcely con·

’ sistent with Id. Arb. xvl.

290. ‘Arbos' here is evidently distin-
guished from the vine. The old view was,
that Virg. meant merely to contra-st the
vine with other trees generally; but
Heyne rightly regards it as a contrast be-
tween the vine and its supportet. Comp.
notes on vv. 2, 89, 267, 278.

‘Terrae defigitur: ’ ‘defigere aliquem
cruci’ is quoted from Varro ap. Non.
[Compare v. 306, E. vm 101 note, G. lv
115: in A. κη 130, ‘defigunt tellure
hastas’ seems the better reading] The
construction is ‘ arbos altior defigitur ac
penitus terrae defigitur.'

It appears from the passages just cited
srom Col. and Pliny, that other trees were
never planted at so slight a depth as the
vine sometimes was, but the difference is

not so great as this pmage would denote.
