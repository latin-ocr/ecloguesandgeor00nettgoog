lengthened out her farewell, saying, ‘ Vale,
vale,’ in her reluctance to part. SoWagn.
rightly interprets it. ‘ Longum ’ goes
with ‘inquit,' not with ‘vale3’ so ‘lon um

84. ‘ Pollio: ’ [here and lv 12 our best
extant MSS. have ‘ Pollio: not ‘ Polio':
Serv. mentions both forms. The MSS.
of other authors (Juv.‚ Martial, etc.) vary,
but the Capitoline Triumph-lists, which
are little later in date than the Bet, spell
⁶ Pollio’ (C. 1. L. ip. 50, ed. 2), and so most
early and late inscriptions. Nevertheless
Ribbeck, Wolfflin, Thilo and other edd.
cling to ‘ Poli0.' See G. lv 243.] In

No reason drawn lrom the proprieties
of composition could be urged against
taking ‘ vitulam ' and ‘ taurum ' here as
the prizes of different kinds of poetry3
but the ‘nova carmina ’ were tragedieS,
and the bull was the prize os dithyrambic
contests. It is safer to say that the victim
rises with the rise from critic (lectori) and
patron to poet. [Sum-notes: ‘ vel pascite

There seems no occasion to suppose that
a sacrifice for Pollio's safety is intended.

Observe how studiously Virg. avoids
shortening the last syllable of ‘ Polli0,’
unlike Hor. Od. 11 i 14, S. 1x42. Servius
and two of Ribbeck’s cursives have ‘quam-
vis sit.’

85. Gebauer‚ p. 219, points out a faint
resemblance in this and the following line
to Theocr. vm 33-35.

86. Some take ‘nova carmina’ to mean
tragedies on Roman sub'ects, not borrowed
from the Greek; but t ' is too specific.
