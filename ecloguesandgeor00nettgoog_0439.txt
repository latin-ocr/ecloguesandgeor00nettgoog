nec responsa potest consultus reddere vateS,
ac vix suppositi tinguntur sanguine cultri
summaque ieiuna sanie infuscatur harena.
hinc laetis vituli volgo moriuntur in herbiS‚

et dulcis animas plena ad praesepia reddunt;

hinc canibus blandis rabies venit, et quatit aegros
tussis anhela sues ac faucibus angit obessis,
labitur infelix studiorum atque immemor herbae

490. ‘ Inde‚' from that victim, con-
nected with ‘impositis fibris)

‘ Imponere ’ of offerings ι A. 1 49.

‘ Fibris‚’ 1 484. The refusal of the
flame to kindle, here arising from the state
of the animal, was a bad omen. Soph.
Ant. 1006.

491. This seems to introduce a new
thought, the deficiency or corruption of
some of the interior of the animal,
what was called ‘exta muta’ (Heyne).

492. ‘Suppositi. ' the throat was cut
from beneath; ‘Supponunt alii cultros?
A. V1 248. The line is almost repeated
b Ovid.

y493. The thin gore just dyes the sur-
sace of the saud.

494. The herbage was tainted, as
Wagn. remarks· ‘laetis’ merely denotes
luxuriance, answering to ‘plena ad prae·

‘Obessis’ seems to express the swelling
os the throat, as Serv. takes it, though
applicable eno h to the natural state ugof
the animal. [⁸ bessis' Rom. and origin-

Languagep.112.]

the disease advanced‚ their eyes glaretl,
they breathed with di’fficulty y‚gore fiowed
from their nostrils, and their throats
swelled. The one remedy was a draught
of wine; but in time this maddened

498. ‘Infelix studiorum :' see 1 277,
[Roby 1321. No precisejparallel occurs,
and] the exact sense of the phrase is not
clear. A horse might be‘ felix studio-
rum ’either 25 feeling pride in his occu·
pation or as successful' ιιι it: the negative
of either would suit the sense here. Any-
how, there is more force in joining the
words than (with Philarg3 and Heyne)
