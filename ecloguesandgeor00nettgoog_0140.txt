Tityrus. ‘You can talk of the migration
of nations as a synonym for impossibility3
we have to experience it as a reality.’

‘Alii’ answers to ‘pars’ So ‘ pars . . .
sunt qui,’ Hor. Ep. 1 i 77.

65. [‘ Rapidum cretae Oaxen.' So
Serv. ‘quod rapit cretam; Oaxes fluvius
Mesopotamiae . . vel fluvius Scythiae: in
Creta insula non est, sed est aqua cretei
coloris.’ The constr. ‘rapidum cretae'

Oaxes is meant for a Scythian river, pos·
sibly Oxus or Araxes. Justin 1 viii 1
mentions a river OaxeS, crossed by Cyrus
when invading Scythia, and Pliny vi
48 says the Oxus flowed from a lake
Oaxus. Two other views have been taken
of this line, neither satisfactory. (1) Many
editors (including Conington) read ‘Cre-
tae,’ translate ‘ the Oaxes of Crete,' and
refer to the Cretan town Oaxus (Hdt. ιν
154). But Crete is ridiculous beside the
Sabata, Scythia, Britain, which signify
the ends os the earth, and Oaxus is wholly
insignificant. The argument that dis-

ed Italians were or might have
ἔξω sent to Crete, only makes Crete more
unsuited to the context. (2) Schaper, who
misses a preposition‚ conjectures ‘ certe
veniemus ad Oxum.' But ⁴ certe’ is flat,
and the preposition as superfluous as it
would be in l. 64. or A. 1 2.]

66. [‘ Toto divisos orbe,’ sundered from
the world]

67. ‘ En, unquam ε ’ [in republican
Latin ‘en’ introduced a passionate ques-
tion ; so ⁴ en unquam ’ in Plaut. and Ter.
often. This is its use here, vm 7 3 comp.

sell. 11 367; Ribbec ’s Partikeln, p. 343

68. ⁶ Tugurium ’ (possibly connected
with ‘tego ) is defined by Festus and

Pomponius (Dig. L xvi 180) to be a
rustic, as distinguished from a town,
dwelling.

69. Serv„ the Berne Scholia, and early
editors understand ‘ aristas’ as ‘ messes,’
= ‘annos‚' a sense found in Claudian 4
Cons. Honor. 372, ‘ decimas emensus
aristaS,’ but in no more classical writer.
Ribbeck, adopting it, comp. the Greek
ποιά, and refers to Meineke Anal. Alex.

post tempore ' followed by ‘ post ali uot
aristas,' the stronger by the wea er.
There is the objection‚ too, that ‘ ali uot '
would naturally distribute ‘aristaS‚’w ere·
as the equis-alent to ‘ messis ’ is the plural
‘ aristae, not the singular ‘arista.’ The
alternative is to take ‘ post ' for ‘ posthac ⁹
(which is awkward after ‘longo post tem-
pore ’)‚ and construe ‘ aliquot mirabor aris-
tas,’ ‘ shall I see with wonder a few ears
of corn ’—the soldiers being supposed to
be bad farmers, as in fact they were.
This would greatly complicate the line,
‘aliquot aristas ’ being in apposition to
‘ patrios finis' and ‘ tuguri culmen‚' ‘ mea
regna,’ to ‘aliquot aristas) It is, how·
ever, the explanation preferred by Heyne
and most modern editors. In that case
we must suppose that two feelings·are
mingled in Meliboeus’ question, a longing
to return to his home, and a reflection
that should he do so, he will find it im·
poverished.

7ο. ‘ Novalis ’ is used substantively both
in the feminine and in the neuter. See G.
1 71. It varies, too, in sense, being
sometimes a plied to {allow land, which
is Varro's degnition of it (L. L. v 4, 5 39),
sometimes to ground unbroken or ploughed
for the first time. The latter seems to be
its force here, so that there is a rhetorical
contrast with ‘tam culta ’—‘ the ground
which 1 have broken up for the first time
and brought into excellent cultivation.³
