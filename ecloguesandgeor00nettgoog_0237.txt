BUCOLIC POETS OF ROME. 129

Corydon, who, as they take refuge from the heat in a cave sacred to
F aunuS, observo some verses carved on a beech-tree‚ apparently, so it is
intimated‚ by the prophetie god himself. In these verses Faunus, in
language reminding us sometimes of Virgil's Daphnis, sometimes of
Jupiter's speech to Venus in Aeneid 1, sometimes again of the portents
at the end of Georgic 1, announces that the goldcn age has come, that
justice has returned under the auspices of the youth who became a
pleader in his mother's arms—an allusion, Haupt thinks, to the early
forensic efforts of N ero—that civil war shall be bound in chains, the
senate no longer be sent to the block, and civic honours no more be a
mockery—in confirmation of which blissful prediction he points to the
meteor, then shining, not with a bloody glare, but in a clear sky. The
brothers receive the intimation with becoming awe, and resolve to record
the verses, in the hope that Meliboeus—perhaps Seneca, perhaps, as
Haupt thinks more probable, Calpurnius Piso—may convey them to
the ears of Augustus· The MSS. give this Eclogue the somewhat
inappropriate title Delos, which may have arisen, as Wernsdorf suggests,
from an association in the transcriber's mind between the prophetie
island and prophecy of any sort.

The second Eclogue is called Crocale, from a maiden with whom
Astach a gardener, and Idas, a shepherd, ase in love, and whom they
accordingly celebrate in amoebean strains‚ with their respective produce
as the stakeS, Thyrsis as the umpire‚ and Faunus and the Satyrs, the
Dryads and Naiads, ‘ sicco Dryades pede, Naides udo,' and all nature,
animate and inanimam, as the audience. They appeal to their patron
godS, mlk of their respective occupations, vie with each other in offers
to any deity who will bring the absent Crocale, enumerate their wealth,
boast of their personal attractions, and finally are each reminded that
it is time to go home. Thyrsis pronounces them equal in the following
words:

‘Este pares, et ob hoc concordes vivite: nam vos
et decor, et cantus, et amor sociavit, et aetas)

The third Eclogue, entitled Exoran‘o, is pronounced by Scaliger to
be ‘ merum rus, idque inficetum :' and certainly, though its coarsenees
may be paralleled from TheocrituS, it is not what we should have ex-
pected from an imitator of Virgil. Iolas, on asking another shepherd,
Lycidas, after a stray heifer, finds that he can think of nothing but
Phyllis, who has deserted him. Lycidas had discovered her under a
trec, singing with his rival MopsuS, and inflicted personal chastisement
on her: on which she had run off to her friend Alcippe, declaring that
she would live with Mopsus for the suune. The forsaken lover now
