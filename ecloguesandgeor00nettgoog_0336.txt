same doubt how Virg. means to dis·
{hugtulSh tgleed process descr}bed hiere and

a oue on vv. 244 an again,
which of them is intended by‘ trunciS‚² v.
63, and‘ solido de robore, v. 64. Con-
fining ourselves to the present passage and
vv. 24, 25, we may say that here the pieces
are smaller‚ and have no root, natural or
artificial. 'This agrees with the account

ven by Cerda, who rofesses to have
filerived it from practiocal' men in his own
country, Spain. ‘Secant agricolae scin-
duntque ιιι partes plures caudicem olivae
cui amputata radix, cui amputati rami.
ita consectum infodiunt, ac inde format se
radix, et mox arbor, quod ta stu et,
quia vere mirum. ² Even he owever
not explain whether the wood is cleft,033 as
Serv. would lead us to think, or simply
cut. The e from Pliny xv11 58
(referred to on v. 22) fails us here, aS, in
that part of the enumeration which seems
to apply to this method, the text is un·
certain.

31. ‘Radix oleagina² is mentioned as a
specimen of the several kinds of trees
which are grown in this manner, the
my rtle is instanced by SerV. as one of
them. Comp. A. ιιι 21, 46, the prodigy
of the bleeding myrtle. ‘Pliny (xw 230)
tells us that olive wood wrought and made
into hinges sor doors has been known to
sprout when left some time without being
moved.' Keightley.

‘Sicco ligno’ is a further description of

‘caudicibus sectis-„²

32 ‘Impune,² without damage to the
quality of either tree. We might render

‘by harmless magic.²
34. ‘Pirum' is the subject of‘ ferre.²
‘Prunis. 'the stony cornels look red on
the plum· -.tree The red cornel berries
were and are still caten in Italy, but only
as poor fase (Ovid M. vm 665, Α. ιιι
649, ‘victum infelicem bacas lapidosaque

corna, ² where see Henry). Hence it is
strange to find cornel grafted on to plum,
and some edd. translate ‘stony cornel
trees are red with plums.² But the epithet

‘lapidosa’ shows that‘ corna ’(the⁹ fruit)
is put literally, not sor‘ comos' (the
tree), and ‘ rubescere ' would not suit the
change from the red cornel fruit to the
plum.

35·46. ‘ Listen to me then, husband·
men, bend to the work, and leam to sub-
due this part of nature also; and you,
MaecenaS, join me in coasting along this
spreading main.²

35. Having opened out the subject ιιι
its manifoldneSS, he seizes that as an
opportunity sor bespeaking his readers’
and patron² s attention. For this and
followmg lines comp. Lucr. v 1367, ‘Inde
aliam atque aliam culturam dulcis agelli
Temptabam, fructusque feros mansuescere
terrarg Cernebant indulgendo blandeque
colen o.’

‘quvat ‘Virg. is exhorting to exertion,
and accordingly stimulates enthusiasm by
int to two great triumphs of industry,
ount smarus, planted with vines, Mount
Taburnus, with’ olives. Comp. v. 260,
