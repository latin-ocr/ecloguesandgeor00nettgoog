INTRODUCTION. 159

from the nature of the case, apt to be too narrow for the facts
which they profess to cover: and a reader of Virgil may perhaps
be surprised to find an intention attributed to the poet which
does not display itself prominently on the surface of the work.
Yet Ι may be allowed to say that my own examination of the
poem, extending over a time previous as well as subsequent to
the publication of Mr. Merivale’s criticism, has led me to believe
that the remark is scarcely less true than pointed. Passages may
undoubtedly be shown where little or no trace os the feeling
appears : but it can be proved to lurk in others where its existence
hitherto would seem to have been unsuspected; nor can 1 doubt, on
the whole, that, as 1 have said in a former page, it was as strongly
present to Virgil's mind as to Hesiod's‚ though it is certainly not
put forth in the same homely plain—spoken manner. So far is the
poet from masking the toilsome nature of the task to which he
calls the sarmer, that he everywhere takes occasion to bring it out
into strong light, dwelling on it as in itself a source of enthusiasm,
and urging those whom he addresses to spare no pains to make
the work thorough. Observe the form into which he throws his
very first sentence, as soon as the ceremony of invocation is over,
and the practical part of the Georgics begun. ‘ In the dawn of
spring, when icy streams trickle melting from the hoar mountainS,
and the crumbling clod breaks its chain at the west wind's touch,
even then I would fain see the plough driven deep till the bull
groans again, and the share rubbed in the furrow till it shines.'
All that is ornamental, or, as it may be called, poetical in the
latter part of the sentence, the deep-driving of ⁸the plough, the
groaning of the bull, the shining of the share, tends directly to
one point: hard and unsparing labour. The same spirit may be
discovered in the next sentence, concealed in the single word
‘ sensit‚' which denotes the laying bare, as it were, of the nerve of
the soil to the two opposite influences by a thorough ploughing
twice in each season. A few lines further on we have a passage
which not only enforces strongly the practical duty of work, but
states the theologica} ground (so to name it) on which it restS.
‘ Remember ’—such in effect is Virgil's language ——- ‘ that the
special aptitudes of the soil must be studied. Different regions
have different products: corn is more congenial to one, the vine
