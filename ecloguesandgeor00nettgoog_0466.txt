P. VERGILI MARONIS

crura thymo plenae; pascuntur et arbuta passim Γρ l
et glaucas salices casiamque crocumque rubentem

et pinguem tiliam et ferrugineos hyacinthos,

omnibus una quies operum, labor omnibus unus,

admonuit, tum tecta petunt, tum corpora curant;
fit sonitus, mussantque oras et limina circum.

post, ubi iam thalamis se composuere, siletur

in noctem, fessosque sopor suus occupat artus,

190

nec vero a stabulis pluvia inpendente recedunt
longius aut credunt caelo adventantibus Euris;

181. ‘ Plenus ’ has here the soree of
⁴ repletus,' as Keightley remarks, com·
‘ ΡαεεῙ-ιιιῖιῖᾗξρ 11} ἒξῖ, ῙΞ l’gsogintur' in
order of time would precede ‘ referunt!
The sense is merely that the old bees stay
at home, the yo gather honey abroad.

ffiisions os the style, Mai-tyn remarks», are
of the colour of fire. Col. (lx 4) directs
it to be planted near the hive to colour
and scent the honey.

[N onius p. 202 observes that Sallust
in the second book of the Histories used
‘crocum ’ as a neut., and quotes this line
ofVirg. as an instance os the masc. This
note is repeated in Serv. and the Berne
scholia on this passage—H. N.]

184. Some MSS. connect ‘ operum ’
with ‘laborss but 11 155, A. 1 455, where
the combination occurs, are, as F orb. re-
marks, notin point. ‘ Mors laborum ac
miseriarum qmes,’ Cic. Cat. ιν iv 7.

185. ‘ Ruunt portis ’ ’ recalls mili·
tary associations. Jaco oomp. Livy

010. Serv. observes that as applied to
men it includes bathing as well as eating;

as applied to-bees, only eating.

188. ‘ Musso,' frequentative of ‘ mutio,'
is here applied to the bumming of bees,
as in A. xl 454 to the murmuring os the
old rnen of Latium. In A. x1 345, xn
657, 718, it has the notion of hesitation,
the implied contr-ast being with ιιι-1101111110
111101111100, and takes an infinitive or a sub-

joined clause. [See Nonius p. 427 and

Philarg. here.—H. N ‚J

⁴ Oras‚’ entrances: see v. 38. Aristotle
l. c. adds a circumstance to Virg.’s de-

190. ‘ Sopor suus ' is probably to be
explained like ⁸ vere su0,’ v. 22, ‘ the
sleep they need‚' ‘ kindly sleep.' Forb.
well comp. Ov. M. vl 489, ‘ placido dan·
tur sua corpora somn0,' where the relation
is reversed.
