37. The sun is develo , and an atmo-
sphere formed. Comp. uer. v471. The
words of Virg. must not be pressed, so as
to make him mean that the sun found its
place later than the earth, and thus con-
tradict Lucretius.

38. In the absence of instances of the
trajection of ‘atque' in Virg. it is sasest
to point with Wagn. and Mr. Munro
after ‘altius’ The force of ‘altius' will
then be ‘ higher than before,' when the
elements os the sun and moon were not
yet disengaged from those of the earth ;
or the comparative may indicate the
gradual elevation of the sun into its place.

(Munro). For ‘atque ’ Rom. has ‘utque,'
which Ribbeck accepts.

least one good MS. (Rom.) for ‘ ignotos '
[Pal.‚ Gud., Π, etc.], as more poetioal, the

bette'r than to suppose ‘ignarus' to be
used passively, as in Sallust, Ovid, and
Tacitus, The whole line is probably
imitated from Lucr. v 822, ‘ Terra . . . .
animal prope certo tempore fudit Omne
quod in magnis bacchatur montibu' as·

41-60. He tells of the creation and
early history of man, Deucalion, Saturn,

and Prometheus—also of Hylas, and of
Pasiphae and her passion—how she fol-
lowed the bull in vain through the moun-
tainS, beseeching the wood nymphs to in·
tercept him. This mythology is a strange
sequel to the quasi-Epicurean cosmogony ε
but there is nothing unnatural in making
a cosmogony of some kind precede the
legendary history of the world, asin Ovid's
Metamorphoses There seems to be no

to each, e.g., the details about Pasigphae
as compared with the brief mention of the
earlier stories. [Serv. mentions that
critics found fault with Virg. ‘ nam relictis
prudentibus rebus de mundi origine, su·
ito ad fabulas transitum fecit.'-H. N.]

41. The peopling of the world by
Pyrrha, the reign of Saturn, and the
punishment and crime of Prometheus, are

mentioned without regard to chronological '

order; the first was really the latest in
time, Pyrrha being the niece and daughter-
in-law of Prometheus (Ov. M. 1 390). It
is very possible however that Vi . intends
to represent Deucalion and Pyrr a as the ·
actual creators of mankind, in which case
the reign of Saturn and the story of Prome-
theus would naturall follow them, either
from a confusion o his own, or on the
authority of a different series of legends,

‘ Saturnia regna ' is not in apposition to
‘lapides Pyrrhae iactOS,’ but a distinct
item in the enumeration (as Jahn rightly
remarks against Wagner).

42. ‘ Volucres' for the single eagle,
which formed part of the punishment of
Prometheus

43. The tale of Hylas from the legend
of the Argonauts, given by Apollonius,
TheocrituS, and Propertius

⁴ Quo’ for ‘quomodo ’ (ι 53 note); the
identification of the actual fountain
would not enter into the song.
