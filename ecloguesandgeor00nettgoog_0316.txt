terque novas circum felix eat hostia fruges.

P. VERGILI MARONIS

omnis quam chorus et socii comitentur ovanteS,
et Cererem clamore vocent in tecta; neque ante
falcem maturis quisquam supponat aristiS,

quam Cereri torta redimitus tempora quercu

det motus incompositos et carmina dicat.

Atque haec ut certis possemus noscere signis
aestusque pluviasque et agentis frigora ventOS,
ipse Pater statuit quid menstrua Luna moneret;

quo signo caderent austri; quid saepe videntes

beginning of Tibullus’ description (11 i
3), and associated, perhaps in connexion
with the Ambarvalia, by Virg. himself,
E. v .

hostia a soli. Agna cadet vobis,
quam circum rustica pubes Clamet: Io

fou„ from which it ap rs that the victim
varied according to t e circumstances of
the worshipper. Cato cxxxw speaks of
a sow. In the ‘ suovetaurilia' the sacri·
fices were carried three times round the
assembled multitude, and so in the lustra·
tion of the fleet.

‘Felix' is ‘aus icious,’ not, as Serv.
thinks, ⁸ fruitful,' tflere being no instance
quoted where it is applied in that sense
to an animal.

346. ‘Chorus et s. ·. ’ ‘chorus socio·
rum.’

347. So Hor. Od. 1 xxx 3, ‘vocantis
Ture te multo Gl cerae decoram Transfer
in aedem,' thoug the goddess is invited
there to a chapel, not to a house.

‘Neque ante.’ This may be either an
additional warning to the husbandman to
celebrate the Ambarvalia, as an indis·
pensable preliminary to the harvest, or
an injunction to perform a second set of
rites in summer time (Cato cxxxlv). The
language favours the latter, as otherwise,
taken strictl , it would seem to imply
that the Am alia might be celebrated
any time before the harvest. Still it
would have the awkwardnesspf an ap·

shadowed by the first. Comp. however
Tibull. 11 i 21, where harvest rejoicings
are briefly alluded to in the middle of the
description of the Ambarvalia. The ob-

servances here specified, dancing and
singing, are too common to be fixed to
either festival. Com . Ε. v 73, 74,

349. ‘ Quercu,’ in memory of man's
first food. Serv.

350. ⁶ Det motus : ’ ‘haud indecoros
motus more Tusco dabant,’ Livy vu 2,
speaking of the origin of dramatic enter-
tainments.

‘ Incompositos: ’ ‘incomposito pede,’
Hor. S. 1 x 1, of rough verses.

351-392. ‘Besidem Jupiter has given
the husbandman prognostics. Wind is
foretold by noises on the sea, in the
mountains, in the woods, by the habits
of birds, by shooting stars, by down on
the water. Rain is preceded by thunder
and lightning, b the daecent of cranes,
cattle snuffing t e air, swallows flying
low, 'frogs croaking, ants carrying out
their eggs. and other such signs.

351. ‘Possemus’ Med. (first rendi )
Rom„ etc.; ‘possimus’ (Gud., ΜΞ.
late corr.) was the old reading. ‘Mon-
eret ’ supports ⁶ possemus!

352. ‘ Agentis frigora ventos:
gora ' is the important word, contrasted
with ‘aestus’ and ‘pluvias’ Ovid M. ι

353. There is a slight similarity in these
linae to Aratus, Diosemeia 10·13. ‘ Men·
