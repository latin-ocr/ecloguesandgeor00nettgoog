The poem on the Nature of Things could hardly be over· lfstQ,
looked in speaking of the GeorgiCS, even is there were no avowed
connexion between the later work and the earlier. Not only is
it the single instance of a Latin didactic poem produced by any
predecessor of Virgil whose works have come down to us, but it
is the only didactic poem of extant antiquity which can be put
into comparison with the Georgics for largeness of scope and
elaboration of structure. The Works and DayS, as I have said,
has few of the characteristics of systematic poetry: the poems
of Aratus and Nicander embrace each a limited subject,
which they handle nearly as it might be handled in a prose
treatise. But it is the glory of Lucretius’ poem, as it is the
glory of the Georgics, that it is founded on a theme which in
compass and variety is worthy to be the material of a great
work of art, and that it considers that theme with a reference,
more or less distinct and unvarying, to its capability of affecting
the imagination. The one teaches the laws which govern the
universe of nature, that man may cease to quail before an un-
known power; the other teaches the appliances by which man
may subdue the earth, and live in enjoyment of the simple bless-
ings which nature confers : but both profess to go as deep as life
itself‚ and both seek to impress the mind not only with principles
of truth, but with images of beauty. But our interest in the
parallel increases when we perceive that there is something in it
more than mere coincidence. It is a singular thing that Virgil
never mentions by name any of those whom he sets himself to
imitate. Even in the EclogueS, where he talks of Pollio and
GalluS, of Varius and Cinna‚—nay, of Bavius and MaeviuS‚ he
never names Theocritus, Bion, or MoschuS, though we hear of
the Sicilian MuseS, the verse of Syracuse, and the shepherd of
Sicily. In the Georgics he does not name Hesiod otherwise than
by glancing at the song of Ascra and the Aonian mount (111 1 1),
while of Nicander and Aratus there is no hint whatever. The
whole of the Aeneid passes without the slightest reference to
Homer, though we have occasionally a glimpse of Virgil's own
personality, and in one passage (IV 471) a distinct mention of
