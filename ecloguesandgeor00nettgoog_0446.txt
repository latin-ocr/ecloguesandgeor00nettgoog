338 P. VERGILI MARONIS

LIBER QUARTUS.

Tun culture of bees forms the subject os the Fourth Book. In the first part of it
(vv. 1-115) the poet deals with hives and hiving‚ and passes on to a brief digression
(vv. 116-148) in which h‘e apologizes for the absence of any disquisition on gardening,
and describes a visit once paid by him to a gardener at Tarentum. He then (vv. 149-
314) returns to bees, their nature, the belief that they are inspired, their diseases, and
devotes the rest of the book (vv. 315·566) to a famous account of the story of
Aristaeus, suggested by the Egyptian device for rearing bees from the carcasses of
cattle. '

The story of Aristaeus, or at least the legend of Orpheus contained in it (vv. 453-
537) seems not to have formed the original conclusion of the book. Servius twice
tells us (E. x 1 and G. lv 1) that the poet Cornelius Gallus ‘ suit amicus Vergilii adeo
ut quartus Georgicorum a medio usque ad finem eius laudes teneret, quas postea
iubente Augusto in Aristaei fabulam mutavit! Heyne‚ Voss and others-{most recently
Pulvermacher in his tract ‘ de Georgicis retractatis‚’ pp. 32·42]—-discredit this, seeing
nothing in the subject of the book to suggest any elaborate panegyric on Gallus·
Keighssey, however, points out that the mention of the Egyptian device sor rearing bees
(vv. 287 foll.) may have led up to an eulogy on the man who was the first governor of
Egypt [Re. 30-27 ?]‚ and, if this was the case, we can understand the topographical
overloading of the lines describing that country. The subsequent disgrace of Gallus
and his suicide in B.c. 26 supply an adequate motive for the suppression of the eulogy
and the substitution of something else. How much may have been suppresse& we
cannot decide. Keightley thihks the passage extended only to a few lines which were
fairly easily removed. [Schanz in his ⁴ History of Roman Literature' (ii 32) would
limit the alteration to the legend of Orpheus: Proteus, he argues, is asked to reveal
the secret of rearing bees (v. 449), and his inappropriate reply about Orpheus may be
a substitute for a panegyric on Gallus] But there is no difficulty in taking the
assertion of Servius as it standS‚ and in supposing that the episode of Gallus was as
considerable in its range and pretensions as the episode of Aristaeus. In the Sixth
Eclogue Virgil introduced his friend among the personages of the old mythology : he

may well have contrived here that his bees should hum the praises of Gallus through
half a book, and yet not weary the reader.
