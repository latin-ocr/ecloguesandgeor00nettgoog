omnia carminibus vestrum servasse Menalcan.

P. VERGILI MARONIS

10

M. Audiera5‚ et fama suit; set carmina tantum
nostra valent, Lycida, tela inter Martia, quantum
Chaonias dicunt aquila veniente columbas
quod nisi me quacumque novas incidere lites
antesinistra cava monuisset ab ilice cornix, 15
nec tuus hic Moeris, nec viveret ipse Menalcas,
L. Heu, cadit in quemquam tantum scelus? heu, tua nobis
paene simul tecum solacia rapta, Menalca?
quis caneret Nymphas? quis humum florentibus herbis ς’,

10. See Introd. ‘Vestrum,’ because
Moeris had spoken in the plural, as for
the whole household.

11-16. ’Μ So people believed: but
soldiers do not respect poetry: in fact, we
were nearly killed)

1⁸1. ‘ Audieras ' affirmative, not-interro·
tggtgvfiim'hffmoely to singultev ῗζὲῑιὲοω geals-:3221
it. ⁸ YeS‚ so you did, and so the story
went.' [‘Set pat—H. N.]

12. ⁸ Nostra‚' speaking for Menalcas in
particular. Serv. quotes Cic. Pro Milone
4, ‘ silent leges inter arma..'

13. ⁶ Chaonias‚’ referri to the doves
of Dodona—a literary epit et: see 1 54.
With the langnage‚ as Heyne observes,
comp. Lucr. 111 752, ‘accipiter fugiens
veniente columba 3 ' with the thought comp.
Soph. Aj. 169.

14. ‘ Me.’ ‘We may sup se that
Moeris first observed the rop etic bird,
and that he then inform Menalcas of
what it portended.' Keightley.

‘Incidere ludum,' Hor. Ep. 1 xiv 36
[and often.] Comp. Serv. on v. 1, ‘ se om·
nem litem amputaturum interfecto Ver-
gilio.' Pal. has ‘ quocumque.’

15. The appearance of a raven on the
left hand seems simply to have constituted
“ the aug-ary a credib e one. Cic. De Div.
1 xxxix 85, ‘Quid (habet) augur, cur a
dextra corvus, a sinistra cornix faciat
ratum?’ Plaut. Asin. 11 i 12, ‘Picus et
cornix a laeva, corvus. parra a dextera.'
What determined the character of the
gugury to be favour-able or the reverse
tffiss‘t'iassptiffle fimssffsss'd'fflngwffiiss
hollowness of the oak. Martyn however
observes with some justice that the present
omen may be regarded as lucky or un·
lucky‚ according as we choose to look at

Menalcas’ escape or the loss of his pro·
perty. All that we can say is that it was
a warning‚ as in Hor. od. 111 xxvii 15,
‘ Teque nec laevus vetet ire picus Nec

a cormx.'

‘ Antoeinistra indivise legendum‚’ Serv. ,
who interprets ‘ ab antica ad sinistram
partem.’—-—H. N. The word occurs no-
where else. Conington and all other
editors read ‘ ante stnistrass]

16. ⁸ Hic‚’ the speaker himself, like
ὅδε. ‘Tibi erunt ta verba, huic ho·
mini verbera-³ er. Haut. 11 iii 1 15.
Comp. A. 1 98. So‘ hic'and ‘ipse ’ are
contrasted above 111 3.

17⁴⁵· ⁴1.. Was Menalcas so near
death? Who could write verses like his,
such as those of his where he commends
his sheep to Tityrus? '

¹7· ‘Caditz' ‘noncadit . . . inhunc
hominem ista suspici0‚' Cic. Pro Sull. 27,
etc. In such expressions ‘ cadere ’ seems
tobeusedin the sense of‘is the lot'or
⁶ of,’ so that ‘suspicio cadit in ali-
quem ’ is little more than equivalent to
‘ cadit aliquis in suspicionem. ' So τυγχάνειν
is used indifferently of the thing happening
and the person to whom it happens.

18. ‘ Solacia ' is referred
cifically to the song on Daphnis, which is
alluded to in the next ναι-»ες but the ap·
plication is doubtlaes more general.

19. The allusion is seemmgly to v 20,
40, on which latter see the note. The
song is that of Mopsu8‚ not that of Menal-
cas; but Menalcas is apparently regarded
as the t who rehearses his fnend s song
as wel as his own, 'ust as he there declares
himself the poet o E. 111 (v 86, note)—
in other words he is Virg. For the repre-
sentation of the poet as actually doing
what he only sings of, comp. vt 46, 62.
