usually blew on the house and garden,
as the chafl' was injurious to trees and
vegetables. It was to be circular in form,
and elevated a little in the centre, so that
the rain might not lie on it. It was
sometimes flagged, but was more usually
formed os “argilla,'’ with which chaff
and ‘⁸ amurca ’¹ were well mixed. It was
then made solid and level with iammers
or a rolling-stone, in order that it might
not crack and so give harbour to mice,
ants, or any other vermin, and that

might not row on it. Beside the “ παῦ’
was a buil ing named ‘⁶ nubilarium,'' into
which the corn was carried when there

1. c.), but generally it was in the open air.

‘ Cum primis dicebant pro eo quod est
in primis.' Gell. xv11 2. The question
between ‘ cum primis ’ (= ‘inter primos ')
and ‘cumprimis' (=‘ praecipue ) seems
really a question as to the words with
which ‘cum rimis ' is connected ε e.g. in
the present ine it might be taken with
‘ area,’ or with ‘ ingenti, 'or with ‘ aequanda. ’
Here it seems best to refer it to what has

Pal. has ‘ cylindro est, ’ [ ⁴ est ' beingadded
apparently by a second hand.—H. N.]

179. ⁸ ertenda manu,' as Serv. re-
marks, really precedes ‘ aequanda cylin-
dr0,' as the pre ration os the floor is the
first thing. ‘ reta,'= ‘argilla' as in 11
215, as appears from Vari-0, l. c.

180. ‘ Pulvere ro siccitate,’ Philar-
gyrius, the effect or the cause, if ‘pul-
vere’ is taken with ‘victa.' But it may
be a modal abl. with ‘ fatiscat ’ like ‘ rimis
fatiscunt,’ A. 1 123.

.‘ y'atisco ' seems here to have both its

this latter sense it is joined with ⁸ victuS,’
as constantly in Luer. with ‘fessus’

Gud. ς before Heius. the common reading
was ‘ inludunt’ (Med. corr. ). ⁸ Mock the
threshing floor and the husbandman's
labour.’ So in 11 375 the goats are said
to mock the young vine.

Imitatus est itaque utrumque oratiuS,
Nascetur ridiculus mus! Quint. v111 3.
[Serv. has the same story.—H. N.]

183. The use of ‘talpa’ masc, like
‘damma,' E. vnl 28, is noted by Quint.
lx 3, and Serv.

‘Oculis captiz' ‘Hannibal,. . . quia
medendi nec locus nec tempus erat, altero
oculo eapitur) Livy xx11 2, [a very
common use of ‘captus.’] So ‘ capi,' ‘to
be injured,’ Lucr. v 929, ‘ Nec facile ex
aestu nec frigore quod caperetur, Nec
novitate cibi, nec labi corporis ulla.’
[Nonius, p. 249, quotes the line, and says
‘ capere, implicare, impedire.'—H. N.]

184. ‘Inventus’ is probably the finite
verb, not the participle. ‘ Bufo' occurs
nowhere else in the classics.

185. ‘Monstra,’ used of hateful crea·
tures without reference to size‚ as in 111
152 of the gadfly. ‘ Populatque ingentem
farris acervum,’ A. ιν 402.

186. ⁶ “ Curculi0,'’ weevil. This larva
is known to be very destructive to corn
and flour, but only in the granary. Even
with us corn is not lest long enough on
the barn-floor to be attacked by it!
Keightley. Varr0, 1 63, says that when
weevils begin to devour corn, it should be
carried out and laced in the sun, with
vessels of water or the weevils to drown

themselves iu.
