VIRGIL AND HIS ANCIENT CRITICS. xlix

MacrobiuS, a fragment only of whose comment remainS, has more os the
original wording.

Compare also Macrobius 1 xv 10, with Servius on Aen. vm 654· ,
Macrob. 1 xvii 4, with Serv. on Aen. 1 8.

The result of the foregoing comparisons between Servius and
Macrobius is this: that in the great majority os cases where Servius and
Macrobius have identioel notes, those of Macrobius are far the fuller,
clearer, and more logical; that in the collections of parallel passages from
Homer Macrobius has some which Servius has not, Servius many more
which Macrobius has not, and there are many in common. Hence the
natural inference is not (as Ribbeck thinks) that Macrobius was using a
fuller form of the actual commentary of Servius than that which we now
posseSS, but that both Macrobius and Servius were drawing upon older
commentaries and criticisms,

‘ Is it possible to say with any degree of certainty to whom these
works or any of thern can be assigned?

Taking the hostile criticisms in Macrobius and Servius first, with the
exception of those which can with certainty be assigned to Cornutus and
Hyginus (see pp. lvi, lvii), I would observe that there are a number
of precisely the same character and often worded in the same vigorous
and acrimonious style; I mean those which deal chiefly with minute
points of logie or narrative and less often with points of expression.
Such are (1) the unfavourable remarks upon the order of the narrative in
the Aeneid (p. xxxv foll. >3 (2) those m which Virgil ι5 blamed sor wantos
invention in his incidentS, or for observing a wrong order and adopting
an artificia] style m his catalogueS, or for forgetful repetitions of the same
name, or inconsistency in his narrative, or divergence from Homer,
or false taste, or bad mythology, or otlier minor faults akin to these
(pp. xxxvii- -xlii); (3) those in which Virgil is declared to have fallen
below Homer in similar and other passages borrowed from him

(pp. xlii, xliii); (4) those in which he is charged with ignorance of
religious antiquities (p. xlvii foll.).

Now if I am right in saying that these criticisms are expressed in
the same venomous but idiomatic style 3 if it be true, as it is so far as I
have observed, that they are ,all directed against passages in the Aeneid
(the only exception is an apparent one, Macrob. 111 xi 1, where Georg.
1 344 is quoted 3 but this is instantly followed by a line from the eighth
Aeneid: in octavo)-it is natural to infer that they corne from the
Aeneidomastix of Carvilius Pictor, which is quoted by Servius on Aen.
v 21.

5 Besides this, two other works of hostile criticism are mentioned by
Suetonius: the vitia of Herennius and the fitrta of Perellius Faustus.

It is possible, though I do not like to say more, that the criticisms
quoted on p. xxx foll. were taken from the work of Herennius, As to
the sima, it is very difficult to pronounce with any amount of assurance
what was the scope and extent os the work. It may or may not have
included collections of Virgil’s plagiarisms from Homer and the Greeks,
as well as of passages taken from Latin authors But I arn inclined
