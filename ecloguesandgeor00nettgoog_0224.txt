116 P. VERGILI MARONIS

ECLOGA X. [GALLUS.]

11³· the claims of friendship were but scantily acknowledged in the sixth and eighth
EclogueS‚ they are abundantly satisfied in the present, which is entirely devoted to
Gallus. Like VaruS, Cornelius Gallus is said by Servius (E. vl 13) to have been
Virgil’s early associate and fellow-student under Siron. He is said by the same authority
to have been appointedssy the Triumvirs to collect money from those transpadane
towns whose lands were to be spared; and it is conjectured that he may have been
the Cornelius wh0, according to Serv„ attacked Alfenus Varus in a speech sor his
division of Mantuan territory as unfair to the inhabitants Either of these grounds
would be sufficient to account for Virgil’s connexion with him, even if the story of
their previous intimacy should be deemed untrustworthy. Besides, he had been already
admitted to Pollio's friendship (Cic. Fam. x 32, B.C. 43), and so might easily win the
regard of Pollio's protege. His further life need not be noticed here; all we have to
do with is the fact that, as this Eclogue shows, at the time of its composition he had
become known as a poet and a lover, having written elegies (four books, Serv. says),
chiefly addressed to his mistress Lycoris, like Propertius’ to Cynthia, and Tibullus’ to
Delia, and had translated some os the poems of Euphorion (note on v. 50). Lycoris
is identified by Serv. with Volumnia CytheriS, a freedwoman of Volumnius Eutrapelus,
and at one time mistress of M. Antonius, whom the same account represents as the
rival mentioned v. 23 (see note). These elegies are repeatedly mentioned by Ovid,
who appears to have regarded them with high admiration, and once, in an obscure
passage (111 xxvi 91, 92) by Propertius, Only one pentameter surviveS‚ preserved by
by Vibius Sequester.

Here, as in E. 1, the identification of the shepherd and poet is so rudely managed
as to amount to absolute confusion. The subject of the Eclogue is the hopeless and
absorbing passion of Gallus : Gallus, if not a pastoral poet himself, is the friend of a
pastoral poet, and so one of the pastoral company: accordingly he is represented as
being at one and the same moment a soldier and a shepherd, serving in the camp in
Italy, and lying under a rock in Arcadia with wood-gods to comfort him. As before,
the naked simplicity of the explanation has caused it to be missed: Gallus has been
supposed to have gone on furlough into Arcadia, while others, who could not reconcile
the language of v. 44 with his being in Arcadia at all, have changed the text.

The structure of the poem is taken from the latter part of Theocr. Idyl 1, the dying
Daphnis supplying the model for Gallus, whose despair however does not bring him
to death. virgil is supposed to narrate the story in a song as he is tending his goatS,
andin rising to go home for the evening he gracefully intimates that he is closing the
volume of pastoral poetry.

The time is commonly thought, [though Ribbeck and Thilo would date the poem
earlier,] to be fixed by vv. 23, 46 foll„ and by general considerations regarding the
date of the EclogueS, to the end of 38 Ec, or the beginning of 37, when Agrippa
was fighting in Gaul and along the Rhine. Gallus’ rival is supposed to have joined
Agrippa, while Gallus himself was engaged in some other service, perhaps in Italy
under Octavian, acting against Sex. Pompeius. Vv. 20, 23, 47 seem to point to winter
or early spring. The scenery seems to be Arcadian throughout, at least in the
narrative part of the Eclogue.
