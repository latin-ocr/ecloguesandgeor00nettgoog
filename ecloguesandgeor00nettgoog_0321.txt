cause the lovers were changed into Hal-
cyons by Thetis: but it is simplet to say
‘ loved by her as sea-birds. Comp.
Theocr. vn 59. Serv. mentions a strange
reading ‘solut0,' ⁸ i.e. nimium patenti.'

fugai, Lucr.' 1v 713, and the Homer-ic use
of μεμνῆσθαι.

‘ lactare solutos manipIOS,’ to toss them
so as to loosen them ; toss them to pieces.
Keightley says the swine carry straw in
their mouths to make beds for themselves.
[Pliny xvlu 364 mentions as a sign of
bad weather ‘turpes porci alienos sibi ma-
nipulos faeni lacerantes) —H. N .]

401. ‘ N ebulae‚’ the clouds on the moun-
tainS. Comp. Arat. 256-258.

[‘ Campo ' abl. of place, v, 6 note, Roby

class with it ‘terrae defigitur' 11 290,
‘solo sternere' A. xl 485]

403. The night-owl is a sign of fine
weather‚ Arat. 267. ‘ Nequiquasn,' like

407. It is best to take ‘ inimicuS, atrox ’
as two epithetS. Comp. ‘ Acer, anhelanti
similis,' A. v 254.

408. Keightley explains ⁴ qua se sert
Nisus ad auras ' of the greater bird having
missed his pounce, and thus being obliged
to soar into the air in order to make a

second, while the smaller escapes as fast
as it can.

409. ⁶ Raptim :' the primitive meaning
is by a snatch or by snatches; hence
eagerly, hastily‚ quickly. Comp. that
sense of ⁸ rapidus’ in which it seems to
have) the meaning of ‘rapio' (E. 11 10
note .

410. ‘ Liquidas,’ sost, opposed t0 ‘rau-
cas,² ‘ Presso gutture ' apparently opposed
to ⁸ plena voce! The whole passage is
loosely rendered from Arat. 271-277.
Aratus appears to distinguish accurately
between the ἐρημαῖος κόραξ that eries δισ-
σάκις and πλειότεροι δ’ ἀγεληδόν. Comp.
Lucr. v 1083 foll.

411. ‘Cubilibus altis’ seems a loose
version of ἐπὴν κοίτοιο μέδωνται.

412. ‘ Nescio qua‚' etc. ε χαίρειν κέ τις
ὠῒσσαιτο. The Virgilian version is charac-
teristic.

413. ‘ Imbribus actis' may either be
‘when the rain is spent,' like ‘tempus
actum’ (Burm.), or ‘when the rain is
driven away ' (Heyne), but not ‘ when the
rain has descended ' (Wund.‚ who comp.
11 334). The sentence can hardly have
any other meaning than that the rooks are
glad to revisit their young when the
showers are over, though Keightley ob-
have been driven home
already by the shower‚ and accordingly
understands ‘ revisere,’ to review, examine
the state in which they are in after the
storm. Serv. asset-ts on the authority os
Pliny that rooks are a t to forget their
young and not go near t em.
