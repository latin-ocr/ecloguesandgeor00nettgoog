past in Hesiod converted into an anticipation of the historical
future. So the Daphnis of the fifth Eclogue is evidently the
great JuliuS, as the similarity of the images to those in the pre-
ceding poem is sufficient to show; it is a pastoral poet that
celebrates him, and therefore he must be celebrated as a shep-
herd, wept by all nature in his death, powerful and honoured as
3 rural god in his immortality. Even where the poems appear
at first sight to be purely dramatic and impersonal, the poet is
still visible. MenalcaS, an actor in the fifth Eclogue, announces
himself at the end of it as the author of the second and third ; in
the ninth (v. 19) an intimation is made from which we infer that the
fifth also is really his work, the song of Mopsus no less than his
own. The second Eclogue is one which we should gladly believe
to be purely ideal, instead of shifting the tradition which pro-
fesses to verify it: nor need we be anxious to think with Servius
that the song of Silenus to the shepherds is really an epicurean
lecture delivered by Siron to his pupils, But when we find
shepherds rivalling each other for the favour of Pollio, and lam-
pooning Bavius and MaeviuS, we feel that jealousy for the poet's
credit as a painter of life is rather a misplaced sentiment.l

It is as an artist that Virgil appears chiefly to challenge our
admiration, as in his other workS, so also in the Bucolica The
language‚ indeed, which he puts into the mouths of his pastoral
personages is for the most part as undramatic as the thoughts
which that language expresses are conventional and unreal. In
a very few instances he attempts to produce an appearance of
rusticity by an archaism, a proverb, a conversational ellipse, a
clumsy circumlocution ; ² even there, however, he seems to be

² It may be said that in Milton's Lycidas the Virgilian confusion of shepherd and
poet is turned into mere chaos by the introduction of a third clement, the Christian
shepherd or minister. There is, however, this difference, that the object, no less
than the effect, of the poem is not to describe pastoral lise, but to paint student life
in pastoral colours. The tenth Eclogue might take the benefit of the same distinc-
tion, if we could separate it in our judgment from the rest. Milton's use of mythology
might afford another ground sor comparison with Virgil: but the subject is too large
for 3 note.
