the chamber is opened ou the eleventh
day, clusters of bees will be found, while
of the bullock nothing will remain but
horus, boues, and hair. He adds* that

marrow, the common bees from the esh.
He also describes the prooess os formation,
saying that at first the bees will be seen
to be small and white, imperfect and
scarcely animate, motionless, yet in a
state of growth3 afterwards they will
gradually put out their wings, assume

’ hts, or cluster round the windows, to
gt to the light. Finally, he recommends

e opening and shutti of the windows
on alternate days, lest e bees should be
stifled by confinement.

‘ Umor’ seems to mean the animal
juicles, υἱὲ the blood, as Serv. and Heyne
‚efo-ssgris ’ probably refers to the pounding
which the bones haveundergone (seev. 302).

‘ Aut ut ε ’ a few MSS„ including two
of Ribbeck's cursiveS, give ‘ vel ut.’ Hoc

numerosius) 1t is not easy to see why
the poet should have given so slow a
movement to a verse exproesing the ssight
of an arrow3 but he would naturally
avoid ‘ vel ut,' as likely to be mistakeu
for ‘ velut)
