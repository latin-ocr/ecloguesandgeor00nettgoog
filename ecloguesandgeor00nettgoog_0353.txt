saltus et saturi petito longinqua Tarenti,

et qualem infelix amisit Mantua campum,
pascentem niveos herboso flumine cycnos:

non liquidi gregibus sonteS, non gramina derunt, 200
et, quantum longis carpent armenta diebuS,

exigua tantum gelidus ros nocte reponet.

nigra fere et presso pinguis sub vomere terra,

et cui putre solum,—namque hoc imitamur arando—

optima frumentis ; non ullo ex aequore cernes

205

plura domum tardis decedere plaustra iuvencis;
aut unde iratus silvam devexit arator

197. ‘ Saturi:' [‘aut fecundi aut quod
est iuxta oppidum Saturum ’ (Serv, ). For
the sense ‘ rich' comp. PerS. 1 71 ‘rus
saturum ;’ Seneca N. Q. v 9 ‘locos ob
umidam caeli naturam saturos3' Col. x
43 ‘ satur autumnus ε’ this explanation is
ado ted by Con.‚ H. N., and Wolfflin's
Arc iv v 35. It is, however, strange
that Virgil should couple ‘saturi' with
‘Tarenti if he did not mean to refer to
the place, which was well known, Strabo
p. 279, Hor. Sat. 1 vi 59, etc. Possibly he
took the adj. and the place-name both to
denote fertility.] Med.am.p‚r. has ⁸ satyri?

‘ Longinqua Tarenti ε ’ see note on
lv 159. ⁸ Longinqua ’ would have more
force, is we could suppose Virg. at the
time of writing to have been at Mantua.

198. ‘The plain which Mantua lost'
in the assignment of lands (E. 1 and lx).

199. E. lx 27-29, ‘ Vare, tuum nomen,
superet modo Mantua nobis, Mantua vae
miserae nimium vicina Cremonae, Can-
rantes sublime serent ad sidera cycni.’
‘ Herboso flumine,' the Mincius. Comp.
E. vn 12, A. x 205.

200. [‘Derunt,' Pal„ Med. a. rn. p.,
and one of Ribbeck’s cursives ε comp. v.
233. So ‘ desse ¹ for ‘deesse’ Lucr. 1 43,
on which Lachmann quotes Velius Longus
p. 2227 P. in support os the spelling with
one e. ⁴ Desunt, the reading of Gud.‚ is
a mere mistake for ‘ derunt.’-H. N.
Comp. E. vn 7.]

201, 202. ‘ Nay, all that your herds can
devour on a summer's day will be replaced
by the cold fresh dew of one short night.’
This os course is an exaggeration. But
Varro 1 vii 10 quotes a statement that in
the plains of Rosea a pole left lying on the
gmstffd one pa),r tigrius otverlgrown1 by {ge n‘eitjti

epone ι au . ers. ι ,

mihi des nummos. . . . Quos continuo
tibi reponam hoc tridu0.’ Med. and two
or three inferior MSS. have ‘ reponit.’

203-225. ⁸ For corn-crops a dark, rich, '

crumbling soil is best, or ground lately
cleared os treeS. Gravelly soils yield but
scantily3 tusa and marl are infested by
snakes. But a grassy soil which imbibes
and exudes moisture readily will be good
sor ever-ything, vineS, olives, pasture, corn.'

203. ‘ Nigra,’ mlled ‘ pulla' by Cato
cm and Col. 11 10, ς 18, etc. ‘ This is
the colour of the land in Campania, and
indicates the presence of decayed animal
and vegetable matter ' (Keightley).

‘Presso,' etc., which shows itsels fat
when the ploughshare is driven into it.
‘ Depresso aratro,' 1 44. ‘ Fere ’ goes
with ‘o tima frumentis.’

204. t may seem hard to see how the
same soil can be both ‘ pinguis' and
· putris ; ’ Mr. Blackburn however remarks
that this may be the ease with what is
technically termed a free (as opposed to a
stifs) loam, which has a certain amount of
unctuousness when pressed‚ yet is friable.
‘ Namque hoc imitamur arando: ’ Col. (v
iv 2) quotes this line as meaning that the
natural character os the soil actually saves
the manual labour os artificially loosening
the earth (‘pastinatio’). [Comp. also
Col. 11 ii 5.—H. N.]

Med. originall had ‘imitatur,’ pro-
bably introduce by some one who
thought the form passive.

206. ‘Tardis,’ from the load they are
drawing. ⁸ Tardis iuvencis' might per·
haps be taken as an abl. of the agent,
construing ‘ decedere ' as a neuter passive,
but it is better to take it as a modal abl.

207. The meaning is that ground
lately cleared is another kind of soil
