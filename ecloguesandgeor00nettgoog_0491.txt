Pallenen3 hunc et Nymphae veneramur et ipse
grandaevus N ereus; novit namque omnia vates,
quae sint, quae fuerint, quae mox ventura trahantur.
quippe ita Neptuno visum est, immania cuius

armenta et turpis pascit sub gurgite phocas.

hic tibi, nate, prius vinclis capienduS, ut omnem
expediat morbi causam, eventusque secundet.

nam sine vi non ulla dabit praecepta, neque illum

· 389. ‘ Eosdem et pisces et equos dicit ’
(Philarg. ). ‘ Equi marini prima parte equi

postrema resolvuntur in pisces ²
This accounts for ‘ bipedum ς’
but the hendiadys is strange.

‘ Metitur ' is doubtless, as Heyne says,
from the Homeric ἅλα μετρήσαντες = but it
receives force as applied to a sea-god from
the contrast of the expression ‘inmensum
mare‚’ well adduced by Cerda.

390. This points to a legend unknown
to Homer, but referred to by L cophron
1 15 foll„ and variously given by rv. and
Philarg. One version was that Proteus
fled from Egypt to escape from the tyranny
of BusiriS, and came to Pallene: another
that he originally lived in Pallene, where
he had a wife Torone (whence the name of
the town) and two sona, Telegonus and
Pol onus or TmyluS, whoused to wrestle
wit and kill all comem, till at last they
were themselves wrestled with and killed
by Hercules, upon which Proteus in grief
removed to Egypt, thro h a sea-cavera
made for the urpose by eptune.

πρό r' ἐόνπι (11. 1 70), of Calchas. The
same breadth os knowledge is attributed to
the Muses by Hes. Theog. 38, where
Homer’s line is almost repeated.

‘ Mox ' goes with ‘ ventura.’

‘ Trabantur: ’ the snbj. may stand either
by supposing a repetition of ‘ novit,' or as
making a hypothetical assei-tion, ‘ every

but that if there is anything, he knows it.
Med. had originally ⁴ trahentur?

‘ T rahantur ’ is a poetical equivalent for
‘ sint.' lt may be explained either of dis·

394, Homer does not say that Proteus ⁶

owed this knowledge to Neptune, but
Virg. may have been thinking again of
Calchas, who received his prophetie power
from Apelle, 11. 1 72.

397. It is not clear, and it does not
much ⁸ ‘ , whether ‘eventus’ is to be
taken ⁵3⁰2 at has happean or of what
will happen. The expressmn in the one
case will be explained with Wund. ‘ quae
aediderunt mala in melius mutet,' in the
other with Keightley,
secundos!

400. ‘ Tende vim' may be explained
like ‘tendere retia,' ‘ insidias) Or we
may make ⁴ vim et vincula ' a hendiadys,
though even then we should have to seek
for some plausible eitplanation of the com·
bination of the verb with the substantive,

⁴ det eventus
