P. VERGILI MARONIS

armentarius Afer agit, tectumque Laremque
armaque Amyclaeumque canem Cressamque pharetram ;

non secus ac patriis acer Romanus in armis

iniusto sub fasce viam cum carpit, et hosti
ante expectatum positis stat in agmine castris,
At non, qua Scythiae gentes Maeotiaque unda,

turbidus et torquens flaventis Hister harenaS,

350

quaque redit medium Rhodope porrecta sub axem:
illic clausa tenent stabulis armenta, nec ullae

aut herbae campo apparent aut arbore frondes,
sed iacet aggeribus niveis informis et alto

terra gelu late, septemque adsurgit in ulnas.

scale in Italy. ⁴ Contra illae in saltibus
quae pascuntur et a tectis absunt longe,
portant secum crates aut retia, quibus
cohortes in solitudine faciant, ceteraque
utensilia‚’ Varro 11 ii 9. Possibly Virg.
intended his illustration to convey an in-
direct precept to the Italian shepherd.

344. ‘His roof and his home.’ Sil.
tt 441 foll„ imitating this passage,
enumerates among the e of the
Nomad, ‘tectumque focique ln silicis
vents.’

345. ‘ Spartan dog and Cretan quiver ’
are unseasonable reminiscences, like those
in E. X 59, G. 111 12. The Numidian
was not likely to be thus equipped.

346. ‘Patriis' seems to re er to the
manner of campaigning rather than to the
actual amour.

{2122 ’¹ ¹¹1³ ‘¹3¹3ss Οἱὲἰῗείοέὲξί 23¹3?ssss
›esides 'his amour, had to carry pro·
visions, palisades for the camp, etc. (Cic.
Tusc. 11 16), altogether amounting to
60 lb., according to vegetius 1 19.
[Fragm. Vat. has ‘invit0.'--H. N.]

‘ Carpit ’ implics haste, as the next line
shows.

⁸ Hosti ’ is a dat. of reference, such as is
more often found in the case of personal
pgonpunsfpsele ²⁵11& ίΜξὶεί. originally had
⁶ osem, a. ‘ osiS.

[⁸ Quom ’ fragm. Van-H. N.]

348. ‘Ante expectatum ' recurs Ov.
M. ιν 79ο; v111 5; Sen. Ep. 114, etc.
(F orb.) So ‘ expectato maturius.’

⁶ Positis castris ’ i. q. ‘ et castra ponit.’

The soldiers, on coming to the end os
their march, immediately encamp.

Pal. has ‘agmina,' which Ribbeck
prefers, supposing ‘ in agmina hostis’ to
mean ‘ against the ranks os the enemy.’

349. ‘At non:' but things are not so,
i.e. this compat-ison does not hold good,
where, etc. The ellipse occurs lv 530,
A. 1v529: in the latter place however it
can be supplied at once from the context.

The geography is vague, as usual when
virgil speaks of countnes out of the ordi—
nary beat. ‘ Maeotia tellus ' is mentioued
A. vt 799 as an extreme point.

350. ‘Turbidus ’ closely connected with
‘ torquens‚’ which it qualifies (NVagn. and
Wund.). ‘ Hister,’ 11 497.

351· ⁴ Redit ’ expresses the form of the
mountain, stretching first to east and then
to north (Sem). For the exaggeration
which places Thrace in the extreme north
see tv 517.

354. ‘ Informis,’ shapeless, like Chaos ;
comp. E. vl 36 note.

355. The earth is said to rise, because
its height is increased by the ice and
snow.

357. ‘ Tum ’ seems merely to mark the
transition, ‘ Nay, the sun,’ etc. This and
the two following lines are imitated from
Od. x1 15 soll„ where the atmosphere of
the Cimmerians is similarly described.
similar imitations occur Ov. M. xl 592 ς
Pseudo-Tibull. lv ἰδῇ.

‘ Pallentis umbras, A. tv 26, opposed
here to the rosy brightness of the sun,
‘ ruhro,’ v. 359.
