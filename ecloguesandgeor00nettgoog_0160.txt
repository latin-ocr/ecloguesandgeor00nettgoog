D. Qui te, Pollio, amat, veniat, quo te quoque gaudet;
mella fluant illi, ferat et rubus asper amomum.

M. Qui Bavium non odit, amet tua carmina, Maevi,

D. Qui legitis flores et humi nascentia fraga,

M. Parcite, oveS, nimium procedere: non bene ripae

creditur; ipse aries etiarn nunc vellera siccat. 95
D. Tityre, pascentes a ⁸flumine reice capellas:

88. ‘ Veniat, quo te quoque gaudet'
(‘ subaudisvenisse,' Serv. ), ‘ may your lot be
his, and may he enjoy with you the dreamy
felicity of the golden age.’ Such seems the

91. Heyne quotes Theocr. 1 20, Καὶ ra}
βωκολικᾶς ἐπὶ τὸ πλέον ‘luteo Μώσας. Stin,
even if the ellipse were supplied it would
be sufficiently cumbrous to say ‘the lot
which he is glad that you also have at·
tained’ for ‘your lot,' so that there is some
temptation to believe the passage corrupt.

89. The form of the wish is from
Theocr. v 124·127; but there the rivals
are merely trying to outbid each other in
wishes as in other things, whereas here
there is a further meaning. The shepherd
naturally dwells on the rural lories os the
golden age, as existing in fab e (G. 1 131),
and in rophecy (E. 1v 25, 30). T he
poet and³ his admirer are apparently sup·
posed to live together in dreamland.
Possibly, as F orb. thinks, honey may be
speeified as a common emblem of poetical
sweetness (Hor. E . 1 xix 44, etc.), while
the image of the ramme-bearing spices
may mean that the meanest rustic argu·
ment is to produce a sense of beauty.
Com tv 2. There may be a reference
to T eocr. 1 132, where Daphnis, like
Damon, E. vul 52, prays for a change in
the course of nature, νῦν ἴα μέν Kopion-e
βάτοι, φορέοιτε δ’ ἄκανθαι era-A. T us the
blessing is put into a form which had been
used by the Greek poet for a curse, and we
are repared for the counter wish in v. 91.

A l we know of ‘ amomum ' (lv 25) is,

that it grew in the east, and yielded a
fragrant spice. Keightley.

9ο. For these worthies see Dict. Biog.

91. ⁴ Iungat vulpes’ is explained of
{gking for ploughing, the expression

ing apparently proverbial. Suidas has
ἀλώπηξ τὸν βοῦν ἐλαύνει. Demonax,
accordin to Lucian (Vit. Dem. 38), said
of two oolish disputants that one was
milking a lie-goat, and the other catching
the uutk in a sieve. Here, however,
‘iungere vulpes’ and ‘mulgere hircos '
appears to be a sort of comic purgatory,
opposed to the paradise of v. 89.

92-95. ‘D. Strawberry gatherers, be-
ware of snakes. M. Sheep, beware of
going too near the water.’

93. The confused order of the words
and the rapidity of the measure are noted
as expressive. ‘ Frigidus anguiS,' vlu 7.
Ψυχρὸν ὄφιν, Theocr. xv 58.

94. Theocr.v 100. ‘Non bene ripae
creditur,' like ‘ aliis male creditur,’ Hor.
S. 11 iv 21.

9⁶99· ‘D. Keepthe goats from the river:
I’ll wash them in time. M. Get the ewes
into the shade, or they will run εἰῖ again)

96. ‘ Reice: ’ so ‘ eicit ' dissyll. uer. 111
877 [tv 1272. Munro quotes Hor. Sat. 1
vi 39 ‘deicere' trisyll., ‘reicit’ dissyll.
(Stat.) and compares ‘ adicit: ‘ subicit in
Seneca, etc. Grober compares the Italian
‘ recere,' W‘olfflin's Archiv i 221, v 236.]

StatiuS, Theb. lv 574, has ‘reicitque
canes,² calls off the dogs. Virg. apparently
imitated Theocr. lv 44, ' ε erario& τὰ
μοσχία, which is explained by the custom
of shepherds flinging their erooks among
the cattle, 11. xxm 845. Plautu5‚ how·
