one snake in Calabria of special danger,
with sealy back and speckled belly, which
lives on the banks of pools, feeding on
fish and frogs rogs, but in hot weather is
driven into the fields, a formidable enemy

414. There are similar warnings in
Geop. xvmz3 Col. vu4. Pliny (xx1v
19) says that the smell of cedar sbavings
puts serpents to· ssight. ‘Urit odoratam
nocturna in lumina cedrum,' A. vn 13.
415. ‘ Galbanum: gum from a Syrian
lant, is mentioned by Pliny xu 126, as
having the power of smoking away ser·
pe;nts so Diosc.1113.8 The root os the
lant was thought a ecific against their
gite, Sammonicus 8488. Virg. imitated
Nicander Ther. 51 fon„ who recommends
βαρύοδμος ἐπὶ φλογὶ ζωγρηθεῖσα Χαλβάνη
. . . καὶ ἡ πριόνεσσι τομαίη Κέδρος.
‘yChel dr05,’ 11 214.
either signify the intolerable smell of
these reptiles (comp. v. 451, and for the
fact Nicander Ther. 421 foll. ) or simply
= χαλεπός. [Nonius p. 315 and Serv.

‘Gravis' may

read‘ gravi, explaining ιι as = ‘nocenti’
{Iri noxi0,' harmsul to the snakes. —H.

416⁹. ‘Immotis’ gives the reason why

the vipers may have been long seereted
there. The sheds would be moved in
order to be cleaned. Rom. has‘ ignotis)

‘Mala tactu,’ ill to handle, ends a line
in Lucr.114,08 where it means rough to
the touch.

417. ‘Caelumque exterrita it ’ gives
the reason sor ‘delituit’ territa’
refers to the timid nature os the snake.

418. What ‘’coluber is, seems uncer-
tain ς Voss understands it os the ‘ coluber
natrix,’ Linn., which, though harmless,

425

was accused of sucking cows. ‘ Succe-
deret ' Pal.—H. N.]
420. ‘Fovit humum,’ like ‘fovere

larem,' 1v 43, ‘castra sovere,’ A. ix 57,
of constant occupatiori. Comp. 1v23onote.

‘peCa saxa. ’ comp. A. v 274, 275,
and Culex vv. 155 foll.

421. Almost repeated' ιιι Α. 11 381.

422. ‘Deicere' is not an uncommon
term in hunting (Emmm) Here it is
rendered appropriate by ‘tollentemque
minas)

‘Iamquest precept is exchanged sor
narrative, the meaning bei merely‘ this
will put him to ssight. Pal as ‘,namque’
a late corr. in Med. ‘eumq ue!

423. The head is in the ground, the
volume of the body uncoils as the middle
approaches the hole3 the end still has a
curve. The‘ medii nexus 'and the‘ ex-
tremae agmina caudae' before formed a
complicat10n‚ which is now unloosed(‘ sol—
vuntur ',) but the tail still continues to
undulate.

424. If‘ sinus ultimus’ is to be taken
strictly, ‘tardos orbis'- = ‘tardum orbem)
Possibly Virg. may mean, as Forb. thinks,
that, though the head is gone, there is
still time to strike the tail. But it seems
more likely that these details are merely
meant for a icture. Serv. supposes the
direction to ‘Caede serpentem, donec
et caudae volubilitas conquiescat.
