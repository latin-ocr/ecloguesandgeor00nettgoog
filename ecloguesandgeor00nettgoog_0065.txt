7. M. VALERIUS PROBUS.

M. Valerius ProbuS, of the flourishing colony of Berytus in Syria,
betook himself to the study os scholarship, if we may believe SuetoniuS,
only after failing in an attempt to succeed in a more active profession
(‘ diu centuriatum (centurionatum Ρ) petiit donec ad studia se contulit ’).
The study of the ancient authors—and such was the sels-confidence of
the Augustan writers and their immediate successors‚ that Cicer0,
LucretiuS‚ Catullus, and Varro were counted and perhaps half despised
as ancients long before the first century had run its course—soon began
to languish at Rome. But these writers maintained their reputation out
of Italy, and the curiosity of Probus was awakened by reading some of
them with a provincial lecturer. The study of these authors inspired
him to go on to others, and regardless of the fact that the pains he was
spending were likely to gain him nothing but discredit, he determined to
devote his life to the emendation, punctuation, and explanation os
ancient texts. Among these he appears to have paid special attention
to Terence, Lucretius, and Virgil. Probus published little of importance
in his life-time, but left a considerable posthumous work in the shape os ἕ
a ‘ Silva observationum sermonis antiqui,' from which a great deal, I
suspect, has filtered into the work os the later grammarians.

Probus was alive, as we may infer from Martial’s address to his third
book (111 ii 12, ‘ illo vindice nec Probum timeto ³), in 88 Aa). z. but his
merits had been recognized at Rome some thirty years before.¹ He did
not open a school, or form pupils in the ordinary sense of the word.
But he had admirers with whom, like Socrates in a higher path of
speculation, he would converse, and perhaps did more in this way than
he would have done by direct teaching to stimulate the love os antiquity
which marks the scholars of the generation which followed him. His s
influence is very marked in the Noctes Atticae of Gellius, who had ·
known and conversed with friends of ProbuS.

Judging from the remains of his notes which have been preserved in
Servius and other later writers,² one would be inclined to assign to him
without question the first place among the commentators on Virgil. His
remarks on the text of the poet are of the utmost value, whether we·
regard thern as based on his own conjectureS‚ or (as Ι am more inclined
to suppose) on the inspection of excellent manuscripts now lost. That
Probus did not spase himself the labour of consulting the oldest acces-
sible documents we know from Gellius x111 xxi 4, where he is said to
have examined a manuscript of the first Georgic corrected by the hand

¹ Jerorne to ΑΛ). 56, ⁸ Probus Berytius eruditissimus grammaticorum Romae
agnsssgigrrnedes, p. 342, has explanat-iens of Virgilian passages which may come from
Probus and certainly agree with Servius’ notes = see, for example, Ecl. vm 72.
