INTRODUCTION. 13

have passed it over in their search sor something more recondite
and more creditable to Virgil. Their view, as elaborated by the
latest commentators,¹ is that Tityrus is a supposed farm-slave
perhaps a bailiff os Virgil’s, who, going to Rome to purchase his
freedom‚ receives the welcome assurance that his master's property
is to be undisturbed in the general unsettlement; the obvious
truth is (1 am stating not my own discovery but that os my
former coadjutor) that the notions os the ensranchised slave and
the poet secured in his farm, the symbol and the thing sym-
bolized, are actually blended together, so that the narrative is at
one time allegorical, at another historical, Tityrus going with his
earnings to his master, and receiving for answer, ‘ You shall not
be dispossessed by my soldiers.’ The same conventional con·
ception reappears in other places, though it is nowhere else so
clumsily managed. MenalcaS, the poet-shepherd of the ninth
Eclogue, whose strains were so nearly lost to the world, is
admitted on all hands to be Virgil himself. In the opening of
the sixth, Virgil is once more the shepherd Tityrus, who is
taught by Apollo that a shepherd’s duty is to make his sheep
fat and his verses thin. Is Virgil is a shepherd because he is a
poet, his friendS, as being poets themselveS, or at least friends os
a poet, must be shepherds τοο, and the times upon which he has
fallen must be described by pastoral images. GalluS,'the soldier
and elegiae poet, already introduced among the heroes of mytho-
logy in the sixth Eclogue, appears in the tenth as the dying
shepherd os TheocrituS, languishing under the shelter of a rock,
and-consoled by the rural gods ; he is at the same moment in
Italy and in Arcadia, acting with Octavianus against Sex,
Pompeius, and bewailing his lost love in the ears os ideal swains.
Whatever may be the ultimate source os the inspiration which
animates the fourth Eclogue, and whoever the child shadowed
forth as the king of the peacesul world, the poem is evidently a
description of the new era supposed to be inaugurated in Pollio's
consulship by the peace of Brundisium3 but the golden age is
represented as a golden age os pastoral life, where art is to be
nothing and nature every thing, a recollection os the legendary
