viminibus salices secundae, frondibus ulmi,

nec non et torrentem undam levis innatat alnus,
missa Pado ; nec non et apes examina condunt

gives something os an historical character
to the passage, which consequently rises
in poetiml dignity. So in vv. 454 foll. the
effects of the vine are spoken of in the
past tense, and a tale of legendary anti·
quity glanced at.

ards shaped

Tym wheels either of solid
wood or like a drum.

‘ Hinc ’ in both places refers to ‘ silvae ’
generally, not to different kinds of wood‚

445. [‘ Pandas ' is rightly explained by
Serv. as ‘ incurvas,' giving the shape of the
hull( ‘ carina'). Theepithet is from Enn. A.
560, ‘ carbasus alta vocat pandam ductura
carinam 3' cp. Ovid Am. 1 xi 24. See 1

p ‘4lggsi1eress ἔθηκαν. Virg. expresses him·
self as if the farmer built ships, meaning
no more than that the trees which the
sarmer is encouraged to plant and cultivate
are turned to that use.

446. ‘ Viminibus,’ ‘ frondibuS,’ the abl.,
not the dat. Each are actual products of
the trees, not things made srom their pro-
ducts. So, in the next line, ‘hastilibus'
are not the actual spear·shaft3, but the
shoots as they grow on the tree. Comp.
A. 111 23, ‘ quo cornea summo Virgulta et
densis hastilibus horrida myrtus.' ‘ Fron·
dibus:' comp. Cato vl, ‘Ulmos serito
. . . uti frondem ovibus et bubus habeas.’

[The punctuation adopted in the text is
that of Med.]; Serv. speaks os another,
‘ Viminibus saliceS, secundae frondibus
ulmi,' which Heyne and Ribbeck prefer:
but the present pointing is simplet, and
not less rhythmical. Comp. 1 453, ‘ Cae·
ruleus pluviam denuntiat, igneus Euros,’
where the same doubt might be raised.

447. The construction is ‘ myrtus et
bona bello cornus fecundae validis hastili-
bus.' So in 1 58 the verb is carried on

from one part os a sentence to the other,
though they are separated by ‘ at.' ‘ Bona
bello' occurs at the end os a line in Luci·
lius [ap. Non. p. 462, who also quotes
this verse of Virg.]

448. ‘ Ituraeos ’ is a literary epithet.
See Cic. Phil. 11 44, ‘ Cur homines omnium
gentium maxime barbaros Ituraeos cum

’ttis deducis in sorum ?’ [and Bell.

ric. 20. A ‘ cohors Ituraeorum sagit·
tariorum’ appears among the ‘ auxilia of
the first century A.D.]

449. ‘Tiliae leves: ’ in 1 173 it is
‘ Caeditur et tilia ante iugo levis) ‘ Torno
rasile ‘ to be combined as one epithet, like
‘ bona bello, ' The epithets seem proleptic.

453. The context shows that Virg. is
thinki of the availability of certain trees
for arti cial beehivoe. But he has chosen
to speak as if he were referring to natural
hives, doubtless intimating that nature
su ested the thought to man. There is
st‘l a question whether he means ‘the
bees hive naturally in hollow trees [and
thus suggest the formation of beehives],’
or understands by ‘condunt ' ‘are hived
by the bec-master) The latter is more
likely, as two kinds of hives appear to be
spoken of, those of bark (see lv 33) and
those made from hollow trees, and of these
only the second can well be natural. The
