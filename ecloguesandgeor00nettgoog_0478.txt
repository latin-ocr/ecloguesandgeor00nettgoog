P. VERGILI MARONIS

expediam prima repetens ab origine famam.
nam qua Pellaei gens fortunata Canopi
accolit effuso stagnantem flumine Nilum

et circum pictis vehitur sua rura phaselis,

quaque pharetratae vicinia Persidis urguet,

[et diversa ruens septem discurrit in ora]
et viridem Aegyptum nigra fecundat harena

writers. ‘ Sincerus’ is used [regularly in
early Latin os things unhurt or ‘ un·
tainted 3’ ‘corium sincerum‚’ ⁸ porci
sacres sinceri ' (Plaut. )‚ ‘ membra sincera '
(Lucr.). The derivation from ⁸ sine cera ’
is possible (comp. ‘ sedulo ’and the Plaut.
use os ‘sine gratia')‚ and is upheld by
Bre'al, who thinks the word a beekeepers’
term.. It does not suit the sense, but
mffii'sszffzsffffezizzffi‘ssffi from
putrid oxen was common among the
ancients, and lingered into the middle
ages. It doubtless arose from bees having
chosen the hollow of the body (as in
other cases the hollow trunks of trees,
11 453) as a convenient place for hiving;
[compare Judges xxv 8 ς Hdt. v 1 14, etc.]
·Varro(11v 16) mentionsit among the glories
of oxen, ‘ ex hoc putrefacto nasci dulcissi-
mas apes mellis manee, ex quo illas Graeci
βυυ-γόνας (βουγενεῖς, Scal' er) appellant‚’
and (111 xvi) cites a line rom Archelaus
calling bees βοὸς φθιμένοις πεπονημένα
τέκνα, and another, which in a slightly
different form really belongs to Nicander
(Ther. 741), ἵππων μὲν σφῆκες γενεά,
μόσχων δὲ μέλισσαι.

‘ Altius :’ Forb. comp. Cic. Legg. 1 6,
⁴ Alte et a capite repetere,' where ‘ alte’
is explained by ‘ a capite‚' as ‘ altius ' here
by ‘ prima ab origine.'

286. ‘Prima . . . origine,’ A. 1 372.

‘F ama’ = ‘fabula‚' a sense nearl
equivalent to that which it bears in su
expressions as ‘ sama est.’

287. This and the five following lines
aa? lteffirgffiiqsbsegrus} o {he con uest of
Egy t by Alexander (born at Pel a) and
the oundation of a Macedonian dynasty.
Lucan is fond os the word, a plying it to
Ptolemy and his family, to t e crown os
Egypt, and to Alexandria (v 60; vm
475, 607 ς x 51 1). [So other post-Augustan
poets, finding it metrically convenient]

‘ Fortunata‚' blest in the fertility of
their country, and perhaps in the con·

sequent diminution os labour 3 by no
means a common lace epithet as coming
from the tof e Georgics.

288. ‘ tagnantem,’ covering the land
like a lake or pool, the consequence os its
overflow. Comp. Lucan 11 417, ‘Si non
per plana iacentis Aegypti Libycas N‘ilns

stagnaret ' and lv 134, Sne
Venetus stagnante Pado, fusoque Britan·
nus Na “ 1 Oceano.'

289. ese boats were of ‘ apyrus'
(Lucan ιν 136), or of ware
(Strabo 788 ὀστράκινα πορθμεῖα, Iuv. xv
127, evidently co ying Virg„ ‘parvula
fictilibus solitum e vela phaselis Et
brevibus ictae remis incumbere testae ¹).

290. 0 mention of Persia as near
E t seems to be one of the many exx.
of irgil's vague geolglraphyg comp. v. 211.

‘ Pharetratae: or. od. 11 xvi 6
‘ Medi pharetra decori.’

[‘ Urget’ Med. Gud.-—H. N.]

291-293. [Med. has these lines in the
order rinted above ς Pal. hus 292, 291,
293³ om. has 292, 293, 291. That is,
291 assumes a different place in each MS.
Mr. Nettleehip notes that Serv„ Philarg.
and the Berne scholia comment on 292,
293, 1101 011 291, and brackets 291 as inter·
polated: this ex lains its varying position
m the MSS. an its intrinsic see leneas.
Conington accepted the order of Med„
observing that ‘ the context does not re·
quire anything to be left 0111, though the
passa& is overloaded.’ Ribbeck holds
that irg. wished to better 289 and wrote
291, 292 and 291, 293 as alternative
substitutes (comp. 203 11010) 2 others alter
more violently.]

292. ‘ Viridem’ and ‘nigra’ are doubt·
less antithetical. The opposition is not
much to be admired, especially as ‘ viri·
dem ' appears to be a predicate, taken
clos'el with ‘ secundat ’ and expressing
the e ect of the fecundation‚ but that is
no reason sor suspecting the line. See
Ε. vr 54 for a similar instance. 001119.
