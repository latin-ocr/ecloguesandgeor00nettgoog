relations to the older (εοῐιπτκῑηῑειῑοτε,ιἻἾέω very ffiffie'filt to ffirm anything
with certainty. Comparing the notes attributed to Gallus with those of
ServiuS, l find that while on G. 1 3 Servius and Gallus take opposite
viewS, the two usually correspond‚ though not so closely as to preclude
the hypothesis that one is independent of the other. For instance, on
G. 1 13, Gallus adds a remark which is not in ServiuS‚ and so on G. 1
81. On G. 1 8, 149, their notes are to the same purpose, though
expissiiesseiss‘iffffissssfinsshyrssoivssfi‘gffffiiffiss' 32¹? 3333 fffl‘ffius? The
fact that on one occasion their views are opposite, and that on others
they are independently expressed‚ seems to point rather to their having
both borrowed from the common store of Virgilian commentary which
I have tried to show had been gathered by the end of the fourth
century.

I am inclined to draw the same conclusion with regard to Servius
and Gaudentius, Hagen thinks that Servius borrowed from Gaudentius
as srom Gallus; but although there are numerous instances where the
notes of Gaudentius and Servius coincide, there are some where Servius
is the fuller (E. vm 21: G. 1 277, 284: 1v 104, 111), others where,
though Hagen seestraces of borrowing, Ι should be disposed to say that
the comments were independent (E. vl 79 ε G. 1v 122).¹

Add to this the fact that Servius is never mentioned by name in the
Berne scholia, nor Gallus or Gaudentius in the commentary of Servius.

Another indication which points to the conclusion that the authorities
of the Berne scholia are independent of Servius and Servius of them is
the fact that they several times preserve quotations srom writers of
authority of which Servius has no trace. Thus, on G. 111 147, they in
common with Philargyrius quote Nigidius Figulus De animalibu5‚ while
Servius has quite a different note. In other places they quote a passage
which, though absent in Servius and PhilargyriuS, serves to fill up and
complete the notes of the latter. Thus on G. 111 89 our version of
Philargyrius says ‘ut poetae Graeci fabulantur‚' the Berne scholia
naming Alcman as the Greek poet. Here Servius again has quite at
different note. Sempronius Asellio is cited by the Berne scholia alone
on G. 111 474, Caelius Antipater on G. 11 197 (where Philargyrius’ note
is lost in our version), Asper on G. ιν 238, Nigidius Figulus on G. 1 174,
428, 498 (in all of which passageS, again, the notes of Philargyrius are
lost), G. 11 168, and Suetonius on G. lv 564. For other instances where
the Berne scholia have notes of value I must refer to the commentary,
where I have quoted from them whenever they offered anything worth
preservmg.

¹ E. vt 79, Gaudentius: Quod fecit Procne, hoc dicit Philomelam fecisse, lieentia
poetica ut Gaudentius dicit. Servius: Atqui hoc Procne fecit, non Philomela: sed
aut abutitur nomine, aut illi imputat propter quam factum est. G. ιν 122, Gaudentius:
Cucumis, cacuminis, et huius cucumeris, dicitur, ut Gaudentius dicit. Ser-mus .· Cucutnis
cucumis z nam neoterici huius cucumeris dixerunt.
