P. VERGILI MARONIS

carpere oveS, dum mox frondosa reducitur aestaS,
et multa duram stipula felicumque maniplis
sternere subter humum, glacies ne frigida laedat
molle pecuS, scabiemque serat turpisque podagras

arbuta sufficere et fluvios praebere recentiS,
et stabula a ventis hiberno opponere soli

ad medium conversa diem, cum frigidus olim
iam cadit extremoque inrorat Aquarius anno.

haec quoque non cura nobis leviore tuendae.

round his estate (Cato 11). Comp. also A.
x 258, ‘ Principio sociis edicit, signa
sequantur,' where the language is military.

⁸ Edico ' is followed by an inf. clause as
A. xl 463. There however the subject of
the inf. is the same as the dat. expressed
with the verb; here it is different, though
the dat. (‘tibi' or ‘pastoribus’) ’is not

doae not begin in the south of Italy till

302. Col. (vll 3) says that shee -cotes
ought to look south, and from i . 6 it
seems probable that he would extend the
remark to oats. Varro (11 ii 3) prefers

‘ cadit ’ seem to refer to the sign, ‘inrorat '

‘Spri’nkling the skirts of the departing

305. The MSS. present three reading3‚
. Vat., Rom),
‘hae—tuendae’ (Pal.), ‘haec—tuenda ’
(Med.). ‘ Haec—tuendae ' seems prefer·
able, as enabling us to explain the two
others. ‘ Haec ' is an archaic form of the
nom. fem. pl., used by Plaut. Lucr. Cic.
etc., if not elsewhere in Virg. (see A vl
852). It would naturally be misunder-
stood by transcribers, as it has been by
Serv. and Philarg„ who defend ‘ haec—
tuendae ’ on the ground that the junction
of neuter with fem. is a Latin idiom.
[See Neue-Wagener, ii p. 417.]

Wund. is right in connecting the line
with what goes before (comp. Hor. S. 11 ii
68, ‘ unctam Convivis praebebit aquam ς

has also a re erence to what follows.
