64. Serv. quotes a variant ‘ Veneris,’
for ‘co los, as occurring ‘in Hebri
(libro) ς’ eyne and Gebauer prefer it. But
it would weaken the em hasis which at
present falls on ‘laurea P oebi.'

65-68. ‘ Th. Each spot has its favourite
tree ι but Lycidas will grace any spot more
than any tree.’

65. 1f Thyrsis fails here, it is that he
does not pay so high a compliment as
Corydon: but his l e is more
natural. Corydon had spoken merely of
favourite trees: Thyrsis compares Lycidas
himself to a tree, as being, like it, the
glory of the lace which he frequents.
Comp. v ῥα fo l.

‘ Silvis, probably the plantations which
the shepherd has to take care of, as
‘ horti ' are his gardens or orchards. For
this reason the trees belo 'ng to them
seem to be chosen, rather t an the river
and mountain trees, to be compared with
Lycidas in v. 68 ; it is to the scenes of his
labour that Thyrsis invites his beloved
one. ‘ Pinus' is the πίτυς ἥμερος,
called by Ov. A. A. 111 692, ‘pinus

[Senr. mentions variants: ‘ Fraxinus in
silvis’ et post ‘populus in fluviis' ut est
nunc, in Vari et in Hebri ε prius ‘ populus
in fluviis», dein fraxinus in silvis. ’—H. N.]

66. ‘In fluviis' merely means that the
poplar is a river-trec. [Pliny xv1 77
‘ non nisi in aquosis proveniunt salices
alni po uli. ²]

beautiful youth killed to a poplar cut

‘ cedet.’

70. Virg. imitates Theocr. vm 92, κήκ
τούτω πρᾶγος παρὰ ποιμέσι Δάφνις ἔγεντο,
but the meaning of his words is not clear.
The alternatives are (1) ‘heneeforth Cory·
don is Corydon with uS,’ as if he had in·
tended to say ⁸ primus‚' and then changed
the expression, to show that the highest
praise that could be bestowed on Corydon
was to say that he was himself, and (2)
‘ hencesorth it is Corydon, Corydon with
us ’—Corydon is in all our mouths.
Either yields a good sense, but no ade·

uate parallel has been adduced either for
t e identical proposition, ‘ Corydon est
Corydon,’ or for the use of ‘ est nobis ' to
signify ‘ all our talk is aoout him.’ Παρὰ
ποιμέσι, however, as Gebauer remarks, is
in favour of taking ⁸ nobis ' as ‘ apud nOS,’
‘ nostro iudicio: and perhaps we may
illustrate ‘ Corydon est Corydon ’ by the
o posite Ἶρος ἅίρος of Hom. Od. xv 73.
[ ’erv. says Corydon means ‘ victor, nobilis
su ra omnes.' This may mean either that
‘ orydon ’ was a colloquial term for a
victor, or (as Ladewig thinks) that the
name Corydon could now stand as a
symbol for the highest excellence in sing·
ing, as that of Cicero or Demosthenes m
the sphere of oratory: ‘ Corydon will be
a Corydon'—H. N .]
