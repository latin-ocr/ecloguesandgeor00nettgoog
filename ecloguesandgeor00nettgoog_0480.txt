299. ‘Iam' may refer to ‘bima’ or
‘curvans ' or both. Tine bunock’s second
year is to be past, and his horna already
grown. CornaE. 311 87, ‘Iam cornu

‘Opruitur,’ the r ⁴ of Med. and
the Berne scholia, was accepted by Heius.
‘ Obstruitur ' (so most MSS.) agrees
better with the precept os Florentinum,
that every aperture in the bullock's body
be closedu with pitched cloths. ‘Obsuo’
is much taret word, only four in-
{limites bfmguctitsed by the lexx„ all in

Florentinus sa s that this cloeing up is
totalre lace erthe beust hasbeen

to be first stifled and then beaten to
death-a less likely direction.

‘Plagis perempto’ is probably not to
be erm, as if the aetion were finished

began. The meaning seems to be ‘pl ‘

302. ‘ Integrntn,' unbroken. Floren-

tinus particularly insists that no bl‘ood is . .

to be drawn, a prohibition which Virg.
seems to have torgotten when in v. 542
he makes Proteus tell Aristaeus to cut the
throats os the animala chosen for the pur-
pose. ‘ Per' vnn then denote the medium

303. Florentinus goes on to say that

thyme, and door and windows closed
with mud, to exclude light and air. Astu*
three weeks the charnber is to be opened
and light and air admitted, onte only
being taken to keep out wind. When
the cerense appears to have got air
enough, the place is to be fastened up
again as before, and left sor ten days
longer. ‘Clausum' is twice med by
Columella of a closed place.

consequently whether ‘ inpellentibus un·
