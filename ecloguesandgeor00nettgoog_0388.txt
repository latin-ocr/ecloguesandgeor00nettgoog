505. *Εχείἀίἰ5,’ abl.:
‘armi5,' ‘saxis petere.’
‘Urbem miserosque PenateS,’ ‘one
brings ruin to 5 city, and wretchedness to
its homes) It ι5 difficult to say whether
the reference ι5 to the sack of foreign cities
or to the entrances into Rome of con-
querors in the civil wars. Professor
Seeley has suggested to me that Virg. may
be here glaucing at Caesar, as in v. 507 at
Crassus, and in vv. 508 foll. at Pompey
and his admirers (comp. Lucan 1 133,

‘plausuque sui gaudere theatri ’.) [The
whole passage may however well apply to
the year 33 Β. c. ‘Penetrant aulas et
limina regum' may allude to intrigues
with foreign courts such as Antony had
been carrying on with Media, Armenia,
and Egypt. ‘ Res Romanae perituraque
regna ’ are the fortunes os Rome and the
falling Eastern despotisms opposed to her.
* Infidos agitans discordia fratres ' may be
meant either for Phraates the murderer of
his brother, or sor the Armenian princes
Artaxias and Tigranes. The lines ‘hic
petit excidiis '—‘ ostro ' might well be in-
tended for Antony himself.—H. N.]

506. ‘Gemma bibat? Sena, whom
some commentators follow, says ‘ poculo
gemmeo, non gemmato. ² But there seems
no reason thus to restrict the word. ‘Bibit
e ’gemma' ,occurs Prop.1v v 4, ‘gemma
ministratur' Sen. Provid. 3 Virg., as
Macrob. Sat. vn 1 says, has imitated a
line of Varius, ‘incubet ut Tyriis atque
ex solido bibat auro!

‘Dormiatz’ Med. am. pr. has‘ indormiat’
(which Heius. adopted) or ‘indormitatss

507. ‘Defosso auro, 'buriedz Hor. S. Ii
42, ‘Quid iuvat immensum te argenti pondus
et auri Furtim defossa timidum deponere
terra? [The custom of burying boards
was very widespread throughout all an-

comp. ⁴ be110,'

hoards buried in Virgil's time see Momm-
sen-Blacas, ii 142 foll.]

508. ‘Hic,’ the aspirant to eloquence,
who is struck dumb with admiration of
the successful speaker, and the applause
which greets him. ‘ Hunc,' the aspirant
(‘ hiantem ⁹) to political greatness, who is
caught and carried away (‘corripuit') by
the applause‘ ιιι the theatre (‘ per cuneos ’)
which rewarded popular statesmen. For
the practice comp. Hor. Od. 1 xx 3, 11
xvii 26 [and many passages in Cicero’s
letterS. —H. N. ]

509. ‘The plaudits of commons and
nobles as they roll, aye, again and again,
along the benchesff [In early Latin

‘enim' is affirmative (indeed), not causa]
(for): 50, sor ex. always in Plautus and
usually ιιι Terence, Langen’ 5 Beitrage 262.
The affirmative sense survives in Virg.
here, v. 104, A. vr 317, νιιι 84, x 874, pos-
siblyin Livy xxu xxv 3, and in the com-
pound ‘ enimvero,' * at enim,’ and probably
‘ sed enim' (A. 1 19, 11 164, etc), which
is at least as old 55 Cato.]

510. ‘ Fratrum :’ Lucr. ιιι 70 ; [Catull.
thv 398.—H. N.] Comp. note on v.
496. Is proscriptions are alludcd to,
Virg. would refer to the Second Triumvi-
rate, as Lucr. to Sulla and Marius.

511. * Exilio,' place of exile. A. ιιι 4.

‘Diversa exilia et desertas quaerere terras.'

512. Hor. Od. 11 xvi 18, ‘quid terras
alio calentes Sole mutamus ? ’ is probably
an imitation of this, though Hor. is speak-
ing of voluntary exile. The order in Pal.
is ‘ quaerunt patriam.'

513.‘ Dimovit: ' while war, etc„ is
going on elsew,here he has tilled his lands
and expects the harvest. The same line
has occurred, 1 494, with‘ molitus’ for

‘dimovitst Med. gives ‘molitus' here.

514. The use of‘ labor,’ like πόνος, for

tiquity and the middle ages». For exx. of the fruits of labour, is common, but seems
