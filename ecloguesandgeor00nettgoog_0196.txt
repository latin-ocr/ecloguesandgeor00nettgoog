26. ‘Invidia rumpantur,’ a colloquial
expression, doubtless intended as a cha·
racteristic trait of Thyrsis. Emm. quotes
Cic. in Vatin. 4, ‘ut aliquando ista ilia,
quae sunt inflata, rumpantur.’ The sup·
posed allusion to the story of Codrus the
Moor, glanoed at by Hor. Ep. 1 xix 15,
would be out of place, were it only that
Virg. sympathizes with Corydon and his
friend.

²7· Thyrsis affects to fear that Codrus
may attempt to injure him by ,extravagant
prais& {vl-neh, when bestowed on a person
either by himself or by another, was con·
sidered likely to provoke the jealousy of
the gods, and was guarded by the apo—

‘ Ultra lacitum ' is generally under-
stood [531an His Judgmgnt,’ 1.e. with

extravagant insmcerity5 but it more pro-
bably refers to the pleasure of the gods.

‘ Vati futuro ' is stronger than ‘ crescen-

argues increased sels—confidence in Thyrsis.

29·32. ‘ Cor. Micon offers to Diana a
boar’s head and a sttff's horns, promising
her a marble statue ” his success in hunt· ι
ing should continue.'

29. Corydon speaks in the character of
Micon (see on 111 10, 79), who is supposed
to dedicate an offering to Diana with an
address in the form of an inscription.
‘Parvus,’ as MenaleaS, Theocr. vul 64,
calls himself μικκός, a young boy.

[⁴ Apri ε ’ Senr. mentions a variant
‘capri.’--H. N.]

30. The verb is omitted, as frequently
in inscriptions, A 111 288. For the custom
os offering spoils of hunting to Diana,
