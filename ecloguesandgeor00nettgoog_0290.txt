P. VERGILI MARONIS

paulatim et sulcis frumenti quaereret herbam,

ut silicis venis abstrusum excuderet ignem.

135

tunc alnos primum fluvii sensere cavatas;
navita tum stellis numeros et nomina fecit,
Pleiadas, HyadaS, claramque Lycaonis Arcton;
tum laqueis captare seras et fallere visco

inventum et magnos canibus circumdare saltus,

140

atque alius latum funda iam verberat amnem,
alta petenS, pelagoque alius trahit umida lina.
tum ferri rigor atque argutae lammina serrae—

134. ‘Paulatim ' is illustrated by Lucr-

We ιιι 1,ξιτ have expected‘ ut’ sor‘ et'
here, and‘ et' (which' ι5 given by Aug. )in
the next line. Virg., however, has chosen
to v the expression, coupling a parti-
cular act with a general, and then sub-
joini a second rticular, as a co·ordi·
nate c ause with t e two,

‘Sulcis’ seems to mean not in but by
furrows. ‘Might get corn by ploughingss

135. ‘Quaerit pars semina flammae,
Abstrusa m venis siliciS,' A. vx 6. [Serv.
quotes‘ inter venas saxi ’from Claudius
Quadrigarius. —-H. N.] ‘Abstrusumss by
Jupiter. ‘Excuderetss A. 1 174.

136. ‘Alnos,’ growing on the riverbanks
(E. νι 63, note), and thus suggesting the
experiment. ‘Sensere,’ felt the weight os.

137. ‘Facere nomen alicui' 15 a phrase
(tv 272), to which‘ numeros' is added
byz eugma. With the thought comp.
Soph. Naup. fr. 2(Wagn. ), ’ἐφεῦρεῢ ἄστρων
μέτρα καὶ περιστροφάς. 'Apin-ov στροφάς
τε καὶ Κυνὸς ψυχρὰν δύσιν. Still closer,
if the rallel be allowed, is Psalm cxmfn
4, etelleth the number of the stars:
He calleth them all by their names.‘

138. For the lengthening Ῥ1ε13ᾶ35,’
com E. 11 53 3.n0te

‘Hyadas' '.A 1 744. ‘Lycaonis Arcton?
like‘ Scyllam Nisi‚' Ε. vx 74. Ovid con·
nects the three similarly (M. xul 293),

‘Pleiadasque‚ Hyadasque, immunemque
aequoris Arcton.²

‘'Claram is emphatic. Aratus(Phaen.
40) speaks os Helice as καθαρὴ καὶ ἑπι-
φράσσασθαι ἑτοίμη, Πολλὴ φαινομένη ὲλίκη
πρώτης ἀπὸ νυκτός. The present line is
mainly in apposition to‘ nomina, 'but it

may also refer to ‘ numeros,' as it is itself
an enumeration.

139. The absence of snares is one marl<
of the return of the golden age, Ε. v 60.
Cerda quotes Soph. Ant. 343 foll„ where
man is said to show his sagacity by snaring
beastS, birds, and fishes.

140. See Ε. νι 56.

ι42. The structure of the line shows
that‘ alta petens’ refers to what has gone
before. The meaning seems to be that
the fisher throws his casting· -net as deep as
he can, the largest fish, as Mr. Blackburn
remarks, lying in the deep ools. The
words are elsewhere used os t e sea3 but
they are also applied to shooting into the
air (A. v 508, where the structure os the
line is the same), and there is no reason
why they should not here be used of a
river, of which altus' isnot an uncommon
epitliet (lv 333). To couple‘ alta petens
pelagoque) with Wagn. and Munro, like

‘longius ex altoque' 111 238, ‘extremus
galeaqueima' A. v498, would be, Ithink,
less good. [Serv. recognizes both inter·
pretations. —H. N. ]

‘Lina’ used of a net like λίνα. The
drag- -net is here meant.
143. ‘Ferri rigor,' ‘ferrum rigidumff
‘Rigor auri solvitur aestu) Lucr. ιν 492.
Comp.1d.v1 1011, ‘quam validi ferri
natura et frigidus horror; 11 410, ‘serrae
stridentis acerbum Horrorem, ’which Virg.
ξἰἶῖγρῗέξέηῗῖἓξῖῐ 3503. ὼῧῖῗῗὶ Ῑίῗζΐῖ
os the iron age, ‘Iamque nocens serrum

ferroque nocentius aurum Prodierat?
‘:Serrae ' the invention os the saw
was attributed to Daedalus (Pliny νιι 198),
to his nephew (Ov. M. v111 244, where
the hint is said to have been taken from
the back· bone of a fish), or to Talus (Sen.

Ep. 90).
