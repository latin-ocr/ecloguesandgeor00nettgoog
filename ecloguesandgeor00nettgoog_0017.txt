 

TO THE SECOND EDITION. xiii

said in the Preface to my second volume. The publication of
Ribbeck's apparatus criticus has made a new recension necessary,
though here as well as in the Aeneid I have accepted his facts
without holding myself bound by his judgment. The more im·
portant varieties I have mentioned in the noteS, particularizing
the MSS. in which they are found, and noticing even transcrip-
tural errors when they seemed to suggest any critical considera-
tions. Doubtless the text of Virgil cannot yet be said to be fixed :
but it is satisfactory to know that so much has been added to our
materials for fixing it. Meantime it may be asserted even with
more confidence than before that there are few writers whose text
is in so satisfactory a state as Virgil’s. Variations there are, and
probably will continue to be, as some of the most eminent of the
ancient grammarians appear to have made independent recensions‚
each of which would naturally have distinctive peculiarities. But
the choice generally lies between wordS, each of which has con-
siderable probability, external and internal ; and though the critic
may not always feel sure that he has before him the actual hand
of Virgil, he is not left to the hopeless confusion which unskilful
transcribers have introduced into the text of other authors, The
more important MSS„ though not always accurate representatives
even of their own recension, supply each other’s defects ε the less
important may in general be passed over entirely. The need of
critical conjecture is almost wholly removed. Even the two
instances where, in the first edition, following other editor3‚ 1
had disturbed the text without any external authority, have now
disappeared. In Eclogue vn, v. 54, Lachmann and Madvig have
shown ‘ quaeque ' to be the true reading: in Eclogue V111, though
there is no authority for leaving out the burden contained in v.
76, there is authority for introducing a corresponding burden after
v. 28, which 1 have accordingly done. ‘

In the notes I have availed myself largely of the labours of my
predecessorS. Servius and Philargyrius I have used constantly,
though it is likely that some few of their remarks may have
escaped me, as 1 have studied them chiefly in the commentary
attached to the Delphin and Variorum ClassicS‚ where they seem
not to have been reprinted quite entire.¹ The same collection has
