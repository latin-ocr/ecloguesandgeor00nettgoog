P. VERGILI MARONIS

Thesidae posuere, atque inter pocula laeti

same time we may say that in ‘ praemia,’
asin ‘ utres,' the goat is alluded to, though
it is neither expressed nor understood
grammatically.

‘ Ingeniis ’ Rom., schol. Bern. ς Med. ,
Pal„ Gud. have ‘ingenti53' Serv. and
Philarg. mention both. Earlier edd. read
2320332'Vff‘Pn‘gl'35ffidssi³'1.¹}.³an5⁰¹23?33³
or ‘gmen of genius ’ or ⁴ wgrks of ggnius ς’
it is perhaps impossible to distinguish
which of three equally applicable senses
was meant by Virg. here.

‘ Pagos et compita,’ the soene of the
Paganalia and Compitalia, appears to be
the Roman equivalent of κατ’ ἀγρούς.
Comp. Hor. Ep. 1 i 49, ⁸ Quis circum pagos
et circum compita pugnax Magna coronari
contemnat Olympia? But it would be ha-
zardous to presume that Virg. accurately
distinguished the various Dionysiae festi·
vals. ⁸ Caper ’ seems to point to τραγῳδία,
and ‘ agos ' to the common derivation of
ῗιᾝιίἓ ,ἷὲἓῗωέζίΐηεέεὲ thfi‘fissfflctz'ssz
accounts of the origin of τραγῳδία, that
from the sacrifice of the goat and that from
the custom of giving the goat as a prize.

383. ‘Thesidae : ' the Athenians are
called Θησεῖδαι by Soph. Oed. Col. 1067,
and θήσεως τόκοι by Aesch. Eum. 462.
Comp. also Eum. 1026. ‘ Inter pocula
laeti,’ in their drunken jollity. We need
not press ‘inter’ so as to mean in the
intervals of drinking. Persius has ‘inter
poeula’ 1 30, ‘ inter vina’ 111 100. ‘ In
poculis ’ occurs Cic. de Sen. 14.

384. ‘ Unctos saluere per utres,’ the
ἀσκωλιασμός, or ame of dancing on the
oiled skin of the lgne- oat which had been
sacrifitigdl. [‘ Saliere ’

385. Thisand the followinglines ap r
to refer to the ‘ Fescennina licentia' ( or.
Ep. 11 i 140) after the vintage, and not to
the Liberalia at Rome on the 13th of

ed. corr. and Rom.

but it is not easy to speak positivel .
‘ Troia gens missa is a sores owing

of the Aeneid. It also intimates here that

the Italian festivities were not borrowed

from Greece. With the construction comp.

ἑξηήῑῖὲιιε parvis' et paupere terra missus,’
vl 11.

386. ‘ Versibus incompti5,' perhaps the
‘horridus ille Saturnius numerus ’ of
Horace, Ep. 11 i 157, which (was the)
national mette of Italy before the intro-
duction of the metres of tireece.

387. ‘ Corticibus cavatis ' abl. of the ma-
terial. The bark‚ being naturally curved,
forms a hollow when strip ed from the
tree. ‘ Os' for the mask‚ li e πρόσωπον.

388. ‘ Per earmina laeta ' may be either
‘in the course of glad hymns,' or ‘ invoke
you by glad hymns.'

389. ⁸ Oscilla ' were small figures or
masks of Bacchus or other appropriate
deity, which were hung on trees that they
might turn with the wind to spread fer-
tility every way. See Dict. Ant. (ed. 3)
‘ oscillum, ’ where representations are given
from ancient art [and the origin of the
‘’‘fffflss‘fssss ‚dssffissafssybmzssssz‘fflsstu
<Ladewig) or of wool, the materials most
used lor ‘ oscilla! Con. referred the word
to the ‘beautiful mild and propitious ex·
pression of the god’s face,’ but this expres·
sion cannot be detected on extant ‘ oscilla’
(see Dict. Ant. 1. c.)‚ while the epithet
can scarcely refer only to Bacchus, and
there is the further objection that ‘ mollis ’
hardly = beautiful.]

390. ‘ Pubescit z ’ com . Theocr. v 109,
Μὴ μευ λωβάσησθε τὰς μπέλος· ἐντὶ γὰρ
ἆβαι. This and the two following lines
might seem to point to a festival before
the vintage. But they more naturally
mean that the honours paid to Bacchus in
a thanksgiving festival ensure a large yield
for the ensuing year.
