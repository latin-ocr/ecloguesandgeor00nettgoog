P. VERGILI MARONIS

417. This is the reading of Med. (first
readings), Rom., Pal„ Gud.‚ and Nonius
p. 30, restored by Wagn. Heyne, with
all the edd. aster the Aldine, gives ‘ex-
tremos effetus! [Serv. reads ‘effectus
extremos,' and observes ‘ melius est ef-
fectus legere quam effectOS, ut quidam

ofkeourse implies that precautions must be
ta en.

419. It may be doubted whether ‘ me·
tuendus uvis ’ here, like ‘ apibus metu·
enda’ 1v 37, means ‘an object of terror
to the grape5‚’ or ‘ an object of terror [to
the vine-dresser] for the rapes.’

[⁴ Antes,’ properly projections (from
‘an-⁹ before), here = ‘extremi ordines.'
The word is explained by Verrius Flaccus
(Fest. p. 16 M.) as = ‘extremi ordines
vinearum,’ the last or furthest rows os the
vines3 Serv. gives this explanation, as
well as another, found also in Nonius
p. 25 and Philarg. here, according to
which ‘ antoe' means the walls of the
vineyard‚ or more properly the stones

rojecting at the corners of the walls.

‘ pedites quattuor agminibus, equites duo-
bus antibus duces,' in two lines.-—H. N.

the vine-dresser has been through all and
done what is necessary for each. ‘Ex-
tremus‚’ the last. Comp. v. 410, ‘Pos-
tremus metito.’ The vine-dresser sings
like the ‘frondator,’ E. 1 56.

418. ‘Tamenz’ ‘after all this work
you will still have to stir the ground‚' etc.
The ‘ pulveratio ' appears to have been a
distinct process founded on the belief that
dust was beneficial to vineS. Palladius
(111 7) says that the process requires re·

contra soles nebulasque prodesse. ' Comp.
also Col. Arb. 82. This notion may be
referred to in the next line, as ‘ metuendus '

no tending, when once fairly started.
{glough the ground, and it will do all for
t ern.'

420. ‘ Non ulla' is a rhetorical exag-
geration. They do not need the same
constant attention as the vine. Rom. and
some others have ‘ non nulla.’ an obvious
error, though mentioned by Serv.

421. ‘ Tenacis‚’ tearing up the ground,
like the ‘ bidens.’

⁴²2· ‘ Haeserunt arvis: ' when they
have once taken hold of the ground ε i.c.
after having been transplanted from the
‘ seminarium,’ Heyne.

‘Aurasque tulerunt: ' so ‘ contemnere

‚ventosss v. 360. Comp. also vv. 332-335.

The meaning here is ‘when they are strong
enough to weather the breezes?

423. ‘ Satis,’ the dat. of ‘sata,' put for
olives, as for vines above, v. 350. There
seems no ground for distinguishing ‘ dente
unco ’ and ‘ vomere.' ‘ Dens ’ may stand
for ‘ vomer,’ as we have ‘ vomeris dentem,’
1 262. Comp. ‘ dentale.’

424. ‘ Cum vomere t ' ‘cum ’ seems here
to express close connexion not so much of
time as of causation, a sense which may
be illustrated by the opposite ‘ sine.' We
might say, ‘as sure as the ploughshare is
put in the ground.’ [So Urbanus ap. δεῖν.
“ statim t arationem.'—H. N.] Voss
and Rib eck read ‘ quum vomere‚’ sc.
‘ recluditur,’ making an antithesis between
‘dente unoo,’ which they interpret ‘bi-
dente,' and ‘ vomere! But this is very
flat, and no opposition can be imagined
between ‘ umorem ‘ and ‘gravidas fruges?
Col. (v 9, 5 12) however recommends the
