74 ’ Ρ. VERGILI MARONIS

ECLOGA VI. VARUS.

THE subject of this Eclogue is a ‹Lo-sgnfflommmmythological song by Silenus, ex·
torted from him by stratagem by two young shepherds.

The poem is addressed to P. Alfenus [arus [consul suffectus in 39 n.0.]‚ wh0‚
according to one of several identifications quoted by Sena, was appointed to succeed
Pollio in Cisalpine Gaul, after the Perusian war (a story harmonizing well with the
. language of this Eclogue, and also with Ε. lx 27). Perhaps he was also the same who
' is said to have been a fellow·student with Virgil under Siron the Epicurean, though
this tradition may be merely an awkward attempt to give an historieal basisto Silenus’
song. Like the eighth Eclogue, it is an apology to his friend and patron for neglecting
to celebrate his exploits, entreating him to accept a pastoral legend as a substitute.
[What these exploits were is not clear. Servius says of VaruS, ‘ Germanos vicerat, et
exinde maximam fuerat et gloriam et pecuniam consecutuS,' a notice which also appears
in the Berne scholia, and which would perhaps deserve little attention, were it not that
Virgil speaks distinctly of his friend’s warlike achievements—H. N .] The confession in
v. 3 of ayouthful ambition to write on heroic subjects is apparently genuine. It is sup-
ported by the story in Suetonius’ biography-that Virgil wished to write on Roman history,
but was deterred by the subject. This aspiration may be said to have been afterwards
fulfilled in the Aeneid3 but the poet’s judgment continued to shrink from the task
of directly recording contemporary victories, though, like Horace, he amused his
patrous, and perhaps himself, with the belief that he might be equal to it some day.

The legend which follows maybe paralleled, if not traced to its source. As Keight·
ley suggestS, the first hint was perhaps given by the story in the &urth book of the
ῼάχξεεχι of Menelaus binding Proteus, afterwards imitated more directly by Virgil him·
self in ,ς-ὶέ-ιν.1 Servius refers to a tale told by Theopompus (the historian, see Dict.
Biog.) and partially cited from him by Aglg‘an (Qu, Hist. 131 18),ἱ that Silenus was
found drunk by some shepherds of Phrygia, bound, and carried to Midas, when his
chains fell off, and he answered the king's questions ‘ de rebus naturalibus et antiquis!
ργὶῤ Q. 241, 90 foll.) briefly mentions the fact of the capture, but says nothing about

· any disclosures by SilenuS, whom Midas restores to BacchuS, and receives in return the

fatal gift of turning things to gold.

The subject of the song was perhaps traditionally connected with Silenus, wh0‚ like
Proteus in G. lv (v. 393 note), seems to have had a memory for the past as well as an
512³. for the future—a characteristic as old as the Homeric prophets and poets, and in-
volved in the legend which makes the Muses daughters of Mnemosyne. The cosmo·
gonical part of it is indicative of that yearning after philosophy as a poet’s province,
which is fixed on Virgil by the testimony, not only of Suetonius, but of his own works,
especially the close of G. 11 ; and was encouraged doubtless by the recent example of
LucretiuS, as well as by the more ancient precedents of the legendary philosopher-poets
and historieal poet-philosophers of Greece (see also note on vv. 31-40 of this Eclogue).
The* general strain of the song is parallel to that of Ovid’s Metamorphose8, and
suggests the conjecture that Vin-gil may have been directly indebted to some such work
as the Ἑτεροιούμενα of Nicander, from which the poem os Ovid is supposed to have
been imitated. [For the title see v. 12 note.]
