importance may easily be underrated. We are apt, perhapS, not
sufficiently to consider what is involved -in the style or diction
of poetry. We distinguish sharply between the general con·
ception and the language, as if the power which strikes out the
one were something quite different from the skill which elaborates
the other. No doubt there is a difference between the two
operationS, and one which must place a poet like Virgil at a
disadvantage as compared with the writers whom he followed3
but it would be a mistake to suppose that imagination may not
be shown in the words which embody 3 thought as well as in
the thought which they embody. To express a thought in

language is in truth to express 3 larger conception by the help
of a number of smaller ones ; and the same poetical faculty which

originates the one may well be employed in producing the other.
It is not merely that the adaptation of the words to the thought
itself requires a poet’s sense, though this is much; but that the
words themselves are imageS, each possessing, or capable of
possessing, 3 beauty of its own, which need not be impaired, but
may be illustrated· and set off, by its relative position, as con·
tributing to the development of another and more complex
beauty. It is not necessary that these wordS, in order to be
poetical, should be picturesque in the strict sense of the term;
on the contrary, it may suit the poet’s object to make a physical
image retire into the shade, not advance into prominent light:
but the imagination will still be appealed to, whatever may be
the avenue of approach—by the effect os perspective, by artful
juxtaposition, by musical sound, or perhapS, as we have already
seen, by remote intellectual association. The central thought
may be borrowed or unreal, yet the subordinate conceptions
may be true and beautiful, whether the subordination be that
of a paragraph to an entire poem, a sentence to a paragraph, or
a phrase or word to a sentence. It is, I conceive, to a perception
of this fact, and not to a deference to any popular or mechanical
notion of composition, that the praise of style and execution in
poetry is to be referred. Poetry is defined by Coleridge² to be
the best words in their right places3 and though at the first
statement his view may appear disappointing and inadeq uate, it
