usque sub extremum brumae intractabilis imbrem; 2¹·

211. ⁴ Extremum imbrem ' can hardly
be the end of the rainy season, sor this
precept is apparently meant to be parallel
to v. 214. Keightley seems right in re·
sen-ing it to the winter, the end of the
year, unless we could take it of the begin·
mg os the rainy season, ‘ the very verge.'

⁸ Intractabilis ’ like ‘non tractabile
eaelum,’ A. 1v 3, that cannot be dealt
with, or, as we s ould say, impracticable,
i.e. when no work can be done.

212. ‘ Lini. . . papaver.' See vv. 77,

78. ⁴ Segetem,' proleptic. ⁴ Cereale ε ’
Ceres was re resented with ppies in
her hands, he was said to ve intro·

duced the ppy, consoling herself with
its seeds in ἷξε grief for Proserpine, and to
have fed Triptolemus upon it. . .

213. ⁸ Humo tegere, of sowing3 in 111
5 58 of burying.

A question has been raised whether
‘ tempus tegere ² is to be explained ‘ tem·
pus est tegendi ‘ or ‘t ere (satio) tempus
(tempestivum est).’ {he same difference
of - opinion exists with regard to other
ffffisss⁰3¹3sess³5ae²³²tn⁸ss¹3¹f ῑὲῗὲἓὸινεῖὴὲζ
some into ‘modus inserendi ς’ others make
it a construction ‘ad sensum,’ as if Virg.
had said, ‘ nec solemus inserere uno tantum
mod0.’ So ‘ Mos est . . . gestare,' A. 1
336, may be explained ‘ mos est gestandi '
or ‘ gestare (gestatio) mos est.' Sc, again,
in A. 11 10 ‘ amor cognoscere ' opmtons
waver between taking ‘ cognoscere ' as =
‘cognoscendi,’ ‘ amor est cognoscere ' as
= ‘ amas cognoscere,' and ⁴ cognoscere '
as nom., ‘ amor' meaning a thing loved.
The first thing to remark is that there is
nothing unaccountable in the supposition
that the infinitive maybe used gerundially,
i.e. in these instances, stand for a noun
in the genitive. The infinitive is equiva-
lent to a noun for almost every purpose 3
even where it follows a verb it can be at
once resolved into a noun, and we know
that it was formerl so regarded in (Jreek,
from the custom o refixmg the article to
it. Every solution τεαὶ has been attempted
of the expressions in question involves this
substantiva] use os the infinitive. It would

215

follow that the construction os the in·
finitive—in other words, the case of the
noun—mustbe determined in each instance
by the structure of the passage. - In the
expression ‘ mos est gestare ' it· is simplest

‘'¹²³¹“ye ἑὲᾱ 'Ji‘ 3⁶33}ss mffledffifff
On the whole, however, the genitive is
the more probable construction in each.
But it is difficult to say what is absolutely
true where, as in all these passages, both
alternatives are equally sanctioned by the
usages of language, while it might be
plausibly argued that the framers os the
355? ⁵53⁰¹1¹12WZ⁰ ςέῗῖ. tf, ,ἴξιὲῖὶηξὲἓῐῑῖἷῗ
may have had both solutions in their
mind, and have taken advantage os the
ambiguity.

‘ Iamdudum' is explained by the next
line, which implies that the time is short,
and ploughing should take place without
delay. ‘ Iamdudum sumite poenas,' A.
11 103.

‘ Incumbere,' like ‘curvus arator,’ E.

For ‘aratris' Rom„ Med. corr. and
Pal. corr. give ‘rastrisz’ but Serv. perhaps
read ‘ aratris‚’ and the context shows that ,
plough‘ is meant.

214. ‘ endent‚'because they donot yet
come down, ⁴ ruunt.’

215. ‘Veret' Virg. was thinking os the
Mantuan custom (Pliny xvnt 120). In
the warmer parts os Italy beans were
sown in autumn, as Varro (1 34) and
Οῑιῗῗίεέἱιίἱὶῗξ· Μηδικὴ (πόα), lucerne, said
to have been introduced into Greece in
the invasion os Darius (Pliny xvlu 144),
