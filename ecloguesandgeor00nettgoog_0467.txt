quod neque concubitu indulgent, nec corpora segnes

194. The fact os bees ballasting them·
selvas with stones is mentioned by
Aristone H. A. lx 40, and other ancientS.

Wagn. from Rom. and Pal„ sor ‘Quod
nec, as more in accordance with Virg.’s
practice in the first soot os a hexa-
meter. The only undoubted instance on
the other side is A. v 783, ‘Quam 1100
Ιοιιςῶἀίω, pietas necmi ’ t ulla,’ where,
as agn. thinks, the owness of the

· measure suits the feeling. '

199. ‘Nixibusz’ so Med. 0 ’ ‘nally,
Serv. and some cursives. Rom„ al. and
Med. corr. have ‘ nexibus ' [and so Pru·
<lentius cath. 111 75.—H. N.], but virg.

is here speaking only of the female. [Cp.
Lucr. 11 225.-H. N.]

200. ‘ Ipsae‚' without the male.

‘ Suavibus,' from which they ther
honey. Aristotle (1. c.) says that 0 those
who held this 0 1111011 some said the
young bees were ound in the cerintha,
some 011 reeds, some 011 olive-blossoms.

Pal. leaves out ‘ e,’ but with Med. gives
‘ e ’ sor ⁴ et‚’ which Ribbeck adopts.

201. ‘Quirites' is a step sarther than

the poet has yet taken3 he now invests ⁰

glories os the Roman {euple Seneca

202. ‘Sufficiunt,’ 111 65.

‘ Refingunt ’ Rom. (supported by Pal.
‘telin nt '); ‘refigunt' Med. etc„ Ser-

vius, ghilaeg. and the Berne scholia, fol·
lowed by Ribbeck. The former, though
a rare word, seems intrinsically the better.

The preparation of new cells or renewal
os the old ones seems 10 be mentioned as
a natural pendant to the renovation of
the race, so that the process which brings
about the latter is associated with the
former also·

v. 183.] agn. thinks they did not
belong to the original draft, but were
written afterwards5 a theory which he
a lies to other passages in the Georgioe.
[T e same view is held by Ribbeck.]
There is certainly great awkwardness in
the present passage3 but either of the two
hypotheses would be hazardous. Wagn.’s
other instances appear to break down, for
