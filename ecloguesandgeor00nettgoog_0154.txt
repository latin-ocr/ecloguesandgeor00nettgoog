P. VERGILI MARONIS

experiamur ? ego hanc vitulam—ne sorte recuses„

bis venit ad mulctram, binos alit ubere setus—

depono: tu dic, mecum quo pignore certeS.

De grege non ausim quicquam deponere tecum:

est mihi namque domi pater, est iniusta noverca;
bisque die numerant ambo pecuS, alter et haedos.

verum, id quod multo tute ipse fatebere maiuS,

35,

insanire libet quoniam tibi, pocula ponam
sagina, caelatum divini opus Alcimedontis:
lenta quibus torno facili superaddita vitis
diffusos hedera vestit pallente corymbos,

‘Vicissim,’ referring to the manner of
proceeding, while ⁶ inter nos ’ merely ex·
presses that there is to be a contest.
‘Vicissim’ may be meant as a transla-
tion of ἀμοιβαίως, but its use in v 5ο
shows that it need not be understood so
stricti .

speaks of a goat with twinS. Keightley
remarks that it is not usual for cows to
have twins. He also remarks that Virg„
in slavishly following his original, has made
DamoetaS, a hireling, stake a heifer from
the herd which he is keeping.

‘Vitula’ is apparently used for ‘iu-
venca,’ as Spobn remarks.

31. ‘Depon02' Theocr. vm xi 12,
καταθεῖναι ἄεθλον. ‘ Quo pignore,’ the
modal ablative, which is really the same
with the ablative absolute.

32-59. 6ΑΙ, Ῑ dare not wager any of
my cattle 3 but 1 have a better stake, two
cups os Alcimedon’s making. D. 1 have
two by the same hand3 but they are
nothing to the heiser. M. No put-offs:
I’ll accept any terms. Palaemon shall be

The grass is so t to sit on, and the country
lovely: so begin, Damoetas, first.' ·

33. From Theocr. 1. c. χαλεπός θ ὁ
πατὴρ μευ χᾶ μάτηρ, it would seem as if
‘ iniustus ’ were to be supplied from ‘ in-
iusta‚' and both construed as predicates.
But it issim ler to render ‘ Ihave a father
at home, an a harsh stepmother.'

34. ‘ Bisque die,’ not merely in the

evening‚ as in Vl 85. ‘ Haedos ε’ besides
ξξιιηὶίης ῑίἒεᾶπιὲῑέοὶίἰὲοοῑι, onet: pr other of

35. In Theocr. l. c. Μρέηῐὲἰσεζ offers to
wager a pi e in default of a lamb, and
DaphniS, li e Damoetas here, says hecan
match it, but, unlike him, agrees to the
terms.

36. Theocr. 1 27 foll. ‘ Pocula,’ a kind ⁶

of dual, a pair os cups‚ as in v, 46, two
being generally set before each guest,
Hor. S. 1 vi 117.

‘ Ponam ' = ‘ de nam.’

37. Cups os beec wood belong to primi·
tive country lise ; Wagn. compares Tibull.
1 x8, Ov. M. vul 669. Alcimedon is not
heard of elsewhere. It is suggested (Sillig,
catal. Artis. p. 36) that he may have been
a contemporary artist whom V' . meant
to comphment. Here and in t e latter
part of v. 43 Virg. had his eye on Theocr.
v 104, 5, though the connexion there is
different. ⁸

38. Servius on A. 11 392 has an im-
probable story that Virg. originally wrote
⁴ facilis,' which was altered because os the
rule forbiddi the use of two epithets with
one noun. ere he says that Donatus
read ‘facilis-»3² and so the Verona fragm.
and (originally) two of Ribbeck’s cursivoe.
But the error is easily accounted sor by
the beginning os the next word, a con·
fusion constantly occurring. Rom. has
‘ fragilis.’ [The Berne scholia only recog·
nize ‘facilis.'—H. Ν.]

‘ Torno ² for ‘ scalpr0,’ the graving tool,
not the lathe.

39. ‘ Hedera pallente corymbos’ is pro·
bably for ‘ hederae pallentis,' a use of the
material ablative for the genitive not un·
common in Virg., e.g. A. vn 354, ‘Ac,
dum prima lues udo sublapsa veneno Per-
