placatam Eurydicen vitula venerabere caesa?
Haud mora3 continuo matris praecepta facessit3
ad delubra venit, monstratas excitat araS,

post, ubi nona suos Aurora induxerat ortuS,
inferias Orphei mittit, lucumque revisit.

immensasque trahi nubeS‚ iamque arbore summa

547. This line contains an intimation
from Cyrene that her son will find his
bees restored, and that then he is to offer
a cali as a thank-offering to Eurydice:
‘you wiu go back to the grove . . .
and then, finding E. appeased, you will
honour her ' etc. The sacrifice of the
bulls and the offerings to Orpheus have
appeased E„ being really offered to her
as well. Possibly there may be some·
thing delicate in the discrimination of the
fiir} iuztofrrzmofftei-lrgngshanaeztgglflngbyvhfflg
contents the wise; but it may be no more
than one of those poetical varieties of
which Virg. is fond. The line has been
commonly understood as merely an addi·
tional injunction, but with this sense
there is much awkwardness in its position

v. 547 before 6.]

548·558. ‘ {ze follows his mother’s
directions, and on returning to the grove,
finds the carcases of the oxen alive with
bees, which swarm on a tree.'

548. For ‘facessit ' Med. and Gud.
have ⁶ ca 't.’ ‘ Iussa capessere’ occurs
A. 1 77, ut ‘to despatch’ is here more
appropriate than ‘to undertake,’ as the
stronger word.

ο549. :Monstratas aras,'like ‘monstrata

e lapide excitare plus’ (o a tomb) etc.

he repetition is of course an imitation
os the Homeric narrative. He e, refer·

1 ‚ and Upton on Spenser's Faery
Queen, pp. 643, 644, finds a reason for
these repetitions in the poet’s wish not to
alter tuitously or tastelessly what had
once n said well3 but in an old epic
writer there is no need to look for an ο
thing deeper than that simplicity which,

addressing a simple audience, thinks '

more of explicit information than of orna·
mental variety, and is only occasionally
visited with unwillingness αὖτις ἀριζήλως
εἰρημένα μυθολογεύειν.

552. ‘ Induxerat,‘ had ushered into the
sky. ‘ Iam nox inducere terris Umbras
parabat,’ Hor. S. 1 v 9.

553. Rom. has ⁴ Orphe0,’ as in v. 545.

554. ⁸ Monstrum,’ a prod‘ , very fre·
quent in the Aeneid, A. 11 , etc.

This passage and vv. 308 soll. above
illustrate each other. Here the bodies of
the oxen are not bruised, but the flesh
becomes deliquescent‚ and the sides give

through.

556. Lucr. 11 928. ‘vermisque effer·
vere, terram Intempestivos cum putor
cepit ob imbris.’ ⁸ Costae' and ‘viscera'
are connected, as A. 1 211, ‘Tergora
deripiunt costis et viscera nudant.’

557. The swarming of the bees is de·
scribed much as in vv. 58 soll. Comp-
also A. vu 64 foll.
