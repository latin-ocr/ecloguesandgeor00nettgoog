[⁶ FrequenS,’ at his post, a military ex·

quens: ut miles a ud signa,' Cic. Verr.

‘Imperat arvis ε ’ ‘ ut fertilibus agris
non est imperandum, cito enim exhauriet
illos non intermissa fecunditas», ita animo·
rum inpetus adsiduus labor frangit‚' Sen.
de Tranq. 15, which however refers to
constant sowing (comp. ‘imperare viti·
bus,' to task vines by making them bear,
‘imperare voci‚’ to task the voice by exert-
ing it), rather than as here to constant
breaking u the ground. Cic. De Seii. xv
5 1 says of ilie earth ‘ quae nunquam recusat
imperium,’ and so the author of the lines
prefixed to the Aeneid, ‘ ut quamvis avido
parerent arva colono.' Comp. the use of
‘ subigere ' (11 50 note).

100-117. ‘Dry winters and wet sum-
mers are best sor the land. It is well to
irrigate the field after sowing3 well, t00‚
to let the cattle eat down the yo corn,
if too luxuriant, and to drain o water
when the land is too moist.'

roo, 101. Macrobius (Sat. v 20) says
that Virg. has followed an old ‘rusticum
canticum,’ ‘hiberno pulvere, verno lut0,
grandia farra, Camille, metes) Ribbeck
imagines that this and the three following
lines contain an after-thought of virg„
not harmonized with the context. But it
is obvious that the poet, wishing to speak
of irrigation and drain e, might naturally
begin by speaking of t e amount of wct
and dry desirable at different seasons:
and the form into which he has thrown
his remarks is simply due to the liveliness
of his fancy. [Plin. xvn 13 refers to the
lines without giving Virgil's name, but
this hardly proves, as has been suggested,
that they are interpolated.]

‘ Solstitium,’ properly of either solstice 3

when used alone, restricted to the sum-
mer. ‘ Sic multas hiemes atque octo-
gesima vidit Solstitia‚’ Juv. ιν 92.

102. ⁸ Moesia ’ (Pal. corr.) is the read·
ing of the older editions z ⁸ Mysia ’ (Mea,
Rom„ Pal.) is required by the context,
being the region of which Gargarus, the
highest summit of the range of Ida, forms
a part. Both readings are mentioned by
Serv. [and the Berne scholia]

The fertility of Gargarus (or of the lands
about it) was roverbial. ‘ Gargara quot
segeteS, quot abet Methymna racemos,’
Ov. A. A. 1 57. The sense then seems
to be, as Heyne takes it, ‘ Mysia is never
so much in its pride, and Gargarus never
so marvellously fertile, as in a dry winter‚'
as if he had said ‘Mysia et Gargara se
iactant.' ‘ Cultu ’ then is not to be pressed,
the meaning being merely ‘ Mysian farm·
ing is never so successful,’ etc. Wagn-
and others adopt another interpretation
suggested by Macrobius, ‘ No Mysian cul-
tivation can equal an ordinary field in a dry
winter: ‘ but then ‘ipsa suas mirantur
Gargara messis ' would be very awkwardly
expressed. A third way, as Mr. Black-
burn suggests, would be to praes ‘ cultu ; '
Mysia and Gargarus owe their fertility to
such seasons far more than to cultivation.

104. ‘ Quid dicam‚’ a form of enumera-

tion, v. 311. ‘ Qui,' antecedent omitted,
asin E. 11 71, etc.

‘Iact0,’ 11 317. The metaphor, as
Kei htley has seen, is fromasoldier throw-
ing ' lance, and then coming to close
quarters sword in hand.

105. ‘ Ruit,' levels, whereas ⁸ ruam
acervos,’ Hor. S. 11 v 22, means to heap
up. So ‘Sol ruit,’ A. 111 508, means

seems to be that of violent movement:
the direction of the movement depends on

the context. [⁴ Ruere harenam' seems to
