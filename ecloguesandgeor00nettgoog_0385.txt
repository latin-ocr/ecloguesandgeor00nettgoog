‘Caelique vias et siderass ‘the stars in
their courses throu h heaven ⁹—probably
a hendiadys. In t ese words Virg. may
have been thinking of Aratus, as in the
following of Lucr.

478. Lucr. v 751, ‘ Solis item quoque
defectus lunaeque latebras Pluribus e
causis fieri tibi posse putandum est,' in
which ‘ pluribus e causis ' explains
‘ varios.' There is no difference between
‘ desectus’ and ‘ labores, ' as appears from
the parallel passage A. 1 740, ‘errantem
lunam solisque labores. ' Comp. Prop. 11
xxxiv 48, ‘fraternis Luna laboret equis;
[Varro (quoted by Serv.) uses ‘laborare'
os a lunar eclipse.] Heyne, who quotes
the lines os Lucr„ observes, after giving
the first verse, ‘Vel hoc uno versu

Vergiliani carminis quanta suavitas sit

intelliges!

479. ‘ Unde tremor terris:’ Lucr. vt
5727&ss vi‚’ through what force of
na ure.

‘ Maria alta tumescant ⁹ is taken, by
[Servius, quoting Lucan 1 412, and] most
commentatos, of the tides. But the
words seem to denote something more
irregular, such as the sudden rise of the
sea at an earthquake (as described by
Thuc. 111 89), or storm5‚ comp. Lucr. v
1002, Sil. xlv 348. [Earthquakes, pro-
ducing earthquake waves, were and are not
unfrequent on the shores os the Mediter-
ranean, particularly near Naples, where
Virg. wrote.]

481. [‘Oceano' abl„ G. 1 246, A. xl
913. ‘gurgite Phoebus Hibero tinguat
equos 3' cs. G. 111 359]

482. ‘Tardis noctibus ' might mean
slow in coming (‘aestivis') or slow in

483. [The line is quoted by Plotius
Sacerdos p. 445 K. as ‘ sin has non possim
naturae acquirere partes. ’-H. N.] For
‘naturae partis’ comp. Lucr. 111 29,
‘quod sic natura tua vi Tam manifesta
patens ex omni parte retecta est.⁹

484. Comp. Empedocles (Stobaeus,
Ecl. p. 1026), αἷμα γὰρ ἀνθρώποις
περικάρδιόν ἐστι νόημα, and see Plato,
Phaedo p. 96 133 Cic. Tusc.1 ix 193
Lucr. 111 43. The Comm. Cruq. on
Hor. A. P. 465 explains the epithet
‘frigidus‚’ there given to Empedocles, by
saying that, according to him, slowness
of intellect was caused by the coldness of
the blood about the heart, which is, at
alny rate, aVnatural 'inference hgom giis

is», that he may be content with woods and
waters‚ and have no thought besides.

they?' ‘Would that 1 were there ξ’
