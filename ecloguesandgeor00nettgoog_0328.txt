220 P. VERGILI

MARONIS

fluviorum rex EridanuS‚ camposque per omnis

cum stabulis armenta tulit.

nec ternpore eodem

tristibus aut extis fibrae apparere minaces

aut puteis manare cruor cessavit, et altae

per noctem resonare lupis ululantibus urbes
non alias caelo ceciderunt plura sereno
fulgura, nec diri totiens arsere cometae.
ergo inter sese paribus concurrere telis

Romanas acies iterum videre Philippi;

482. The notion of overflowing is ex·
pressed here metrioally by a erasm, as in
v. 295 by a hypermeter.

that overcast the sullen entrails, or to the
blood that welled from springs in the
ground, or to the howling of wolves by
night, echoing through our steep-built
towns.’ ‘ Fibrae,’ according to Varro, L.
L. v 79, [Fest. p. 90 M.] and Serv. on
v, 120, Α. vl 599, x 176, are the ex-
tremities of the liver. Cels. ιν 11 says
that the lungs are divided into two ‘ fibrae,'
the liver into four. What the point to be
observed with regard to them was does
not appear. Cic. de Div. 1 10 says ⁸ quid
fissum in extis, quid fibra valeat, accipio,’
which would almost seem as if the mere
existence of a ⁶ fibra ’ was a phenomenon =
but he may merely mean what ood or
evil can be prognosticated from t e state
of the ‘ fibra.' Ovid’s language here is
parallel to Cicero's: ‘magnosque instare
tumultus Fibra monet, caesumque caput
reperitur in extis) Inauspicious a pear-
ances during sacrifice hap ned to aesar
himself, Suet. Jul. 81. iol. c. speaks
of a bull leaping up after sacrifice.

486. ‘ Resonare' depends on ‘cessave-
runt.’ ‘Altae’ seems to point to the
position of the Italian cities on hills, 11

times mentioned in Livy as portenta

ictory, but not of acle-ar sky. A correc-
tion in Gud. has ‘ sinistr0‚' [a reading
which is mentioned in the Berne scholia,
and maylbe right, ‘ sereno ’ being a gloss.

488. ‘ Totiens arsere cometae: ’ Voss
suggests that they were meteors. Dio
says λαμπὰς ἀπ’ ἀνίσχοντος ἡλίου πρὸς
δυσμὰς διέδραμε, καί τις ἀστὴρ καινὸς ἐπὶ
πολλὰς ἡμέρας ὤφθη.

489. ‘ Ergo ε ’ the murder of Caesar led
to a retribution on Rome, which was sore·
shadowed by all these portents.

‘ Paribus :' they were Romans on both
sides. ‘ Pares aquilas et pila minantia
pilis,’ Lucan 1 7.

490, 491. We need not suppose that
Virg. actually consounded the sites of the
battles of Pharsalia and Philippi, as ‘ iter-
um ‘ may go with ‘ concurrere‚' the sense
being ‘the issue of all was a second civil
war. But in the next line he dwells on
the fact that both were fought in the north
of Greece with something less than geo-

wards of Macedonia, so as to cover
Thessaly. Later writers were still less
strict, probably, as Merivale (Hist. Rom.
iii 214, ed. 1) suggested, mistaking Virg.,
whom they imitated. Ov. M. xv 824,
‘ Emathiaque iterum madefient caede Phi-
lippi,' may mean no more than Virg.
does. But Manil. 1 906, Lucan 1 680
etc„ Juv. vul 242 distinctly confuse the
sites· [Serv. and one os the notes in the
Berne scholia say: ‘ Pkdzppi civitas Thes·
saliae in qua pnmo Caesar et Pompeiu5‚
postea Augustus et Brutus dimicaverunt.'
Another note in the Berne scholia is more
accurate—H. N.]
