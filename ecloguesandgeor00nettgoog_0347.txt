GEORGICON

invertere satis inmanis dentibus hydri,

nec galeis densisque virum seges horruit hastis;
sed gravidae fruges et Bacchi Massicus umor
implevere; tenent oleae armentaque laeta.

hinc bellator equus campo sese arduus infert;

hinc albi, Clitumne, greges et maxima taurus
victima, saepe tuo perfusi flumine sacro,
Romanos ad templa'deum duxere triumphos,
hic ver adsiduum atque alienis mensibus aestas;

bis gravidae pecudes, bis pomis utilis arbos,

141. It is difficult to say whether ‘ satis
dentibus ’ is abl. abs. , by a kind of ὕστερον
πρότερον, οι· dat. , as Voss, Jacobs, and
Wagn. explain it. 1f the latter, it should
be taken i. q. ⁸ propter sationem dentium '
(Madv. ἕ 426), not with Wagn„ ‘ for the
teeth sown in the fable by Jason.'

142. ⁸ Seges ' is connected with ‘ virum.’

143. ‘ Gravidae :² 1 319, ‘gravidam
segetem.’ ‘ Bacchi Massicus umor: ’
comp. ‘lacteus umor,’ Lucr. 1 258.

144. Perhaps an imitation of the rhythrn
of Lucr. v 202, ‘ Ppssedere, tenent rupes»,
vastfficgttxzpzlffiffik· [For the juxtaposi-
tion of ‘armenta’ and ⁸ oleae ' comp. v.
222.—H. N .] Varro, Festus, and others
derive the name ‘Italia' from its oxen,
ι’τιιλοί (vituli), and Gell. XI 1 calls it
‘ armentosissima)

145. ‘ From this land comes the war·
horse that prances proudly over the field
of battle.' Comp. A. 111 537, where four
white horses are the first object seen in
Italy, and are interpreted as an omen of
both war and peace.

146. Serv. quotes Pliny as saying that
the water of the Clitumnus made the
animals that drank os it white3 Pliny
however (11 230) does not specify the
Clitumnus, but speaks os the water in the
‘ ager Faliscus,' to which strictly speaking
the Clitumnus does not belong. Virg.
{zisslssgiss‘ssi Zlssffssess 12⁵. “iiimfi {33¹
fines himself to the fattening effect of the
pastures of Clitumnus.

147. ‘Tuo perfusi flumine sacmt’
comp. ‘Teque, pater Tiberine, tuo cum
flumine sanct0,’ Enn. A. 1 fr. 373 G. 11
2193 Α. vul 723 ‘ suo cum gurgite flavo,’
A. lx 8163 ‘ Hunc tu, Diva, tuo recu-
bantem corpore sancto Circumfusa super,'

Lucr. 1 38, etc. This use of possessive

pronoun ancl epithet together belongs to
the earlier Latin poetry. [Exx. frorn
Ennius and Lucr. are quoted by Munro
1G1ucrk1v 394: possibly 1t is copied stom

ree .

[‘ Peifundi ' is the ordinary word sor to
bathe.—H. N.] >

‘ Sacro: ’ Pliny the younger (Ep. vnl
8), speaking of the sourcae os the Cli-
tumnus,’ sayS, ‘Adiacet templum pris-
cum et religiosum. Stat Clitumnus ipse,
amictus ornatusque praetexta. Praesens
numen atque etiam fatidicum indicant
sortes. Sparsa sunt circa sacella com-
plura totidemque Dei.'

148. The white bulls did not lead the
way in the processioa, but they came
earlier than the triumphal car.

[⁴Adt' Pa? and originally Med. have
‘at.’—H. Ν.

149. ‘ Here is ceaseless spring, and
summer in months where summer is
strange3 twice the cattle give increase,
twice the tree yields its service of fruit.'
‘ Ver’ and ⁸ aestas ' are used loosely. The
meaning is that there is verdure all the
year, and warmth in the winter. Lucr.
1 180, ‘Quod si de nilo fierent, subito
exorerentur Incerto spatio atque alienis
partibus anni.' Virg. may have had the
tffss’ffffizffissfflgffi 33.¹5¹21÷‚{.‘13¹rssss²ffi¹.‘3
gives as a derangement of nature.

150. It is not uite clear whether
‘ pomis' is dat. or a 1. If dat., it must
= ‘pomis creandis) The abl. is sup-
ported by Ovid. M. 111 212, ‘ Et pedibus
Pterelas et naribus utilis Agre.’

Keightley refers to Varro 1 7, where
the apple-trees at Consentia in the Bruttian
territory are said to bear twice, as the
probable origin of Virg.’s statement.
