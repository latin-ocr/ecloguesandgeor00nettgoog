xlvi VIRGIL AND HIS ANCIENT CRITICS.

In the third chapter some passages are examined which had been
first translated from the Greek by a Roman poet, 3ηά afterwards
handled afresh by virgil. The only one of these which Servius notices
is Aen. ”149² foll„ and this is only to mention the parallel passage
in Homer.

VI.

In the eighteenth 3ηά following chapters of the fifth book of the
Saturnalia Macrobius has elaborate comments on passages in which
Virgil is said to have drawn upon recondite Greek sources, Let us
briefly compare these with the corresponding noteS, where there are any,
in Servius.

Georg. 1 17, pocula Acheloia: Servius (Dan.) has a very brief extract
os these remarks,

Aen. vu 689, vestigia nuda sinistri Instituere pedis .· Servius says
merely ‘ traxit hoc a Graeciae more.'

Aen. 4 fin., nondum illi flavum, etc. Servius (Dan.), again merely
abridging, sayS, ‘ Euripides Alcestim Diti sacratum habuisse crinem
dicit, quod poeta transtulit ad Didonem!

Aen. ιν 513, falcibus alzemk: Servius is silent.

Aen. lx 584, ara Palici .· the same story is mentioned by Servius,

Georg. 1 100, umida solstitia atque lerientes orate serenas, etc. Here the
whole note of Servius (Dan.) is virtually identical with that of MacrobiuS,
though not so clear or accurate. The paraphrase in Macrob. v xx 14,
‘ cum ea sit anni temperieS, ut hiemps serena sit, solstitium vero im—
bricum, fructus optime proveniunt,' is identical in both commentators τ
3ηά both also quote the rustic verse, ‘ hiberno pulvere, verno lut0,
grandia farra, Camille, metes?

Georg. 1v 380, Aen. 111 66 z carchesia, cymbia. These comments are
not in ServiuS.

Aen. xi· 5 32, Opts. Servius (Dan.) has the same words about
Alexander Aetolus.

Aen. 1 42, {psa Iovis· rapidum iaculata e nubibus ignem. This note is
not in Servius.

Georg. 111 391, munere sic niveo lanae. Not Servius but Philargyrius
has this comment in a shorter form: ‘ huius opinionis auctor est
Nicander: nec poterat esse nisi Graecus?

The conclusion which 1 draw from this comparison is again that
Servius? Philargyrius and Macrobius are drawing upon the same source.
And that this source was one work, not several, is, I think, rendered
probable by the uniformity of style which characterizes the whole of

pose that-this writer-is borrowing directly from Macrobius, as in other placesrhe either
ignores him or is quite independent of him. (See note on p. liii below.)
