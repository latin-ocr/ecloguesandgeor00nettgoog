and recommending it as a new strain, which is to shake the woods os
Helicon. With equal brevity, Caesar, the worthy heir of a world which
the gods gave to his father, is acknowledged as the poet's inspiring
deity. When the universe is at peace, the secrets of the universe may
be most fitly unfolded. The poet kindles fire on two altars, and feels a

twofold heat, the heat of song and the heat of his subject, which is no ;
less than the world itself. Who first revealed such divine secrets to ¹

men Ρ Who but the gods? It was Mercury who first disclosed the
wondrous movements of the stars: Nature assisted in the work of
making herself known, and taught Egyptian and Assyrian kings to
scrutinize that heaven which their power so nearly reached. The next

step was made by the priests, who, long familiar with divine thingS, were 3
allowed to perceive the influence of the stars on human life. Know· Ἴ

ledge was reduced to a system: occult laws were discovered, and the
universe was seen to be regulated by eternal reason. Till then all was
uncertainty: men wept to find stars vanish, and were rejoiced at their
reappearance. Those were, indeed, days of darkness, when earth was
untilled, mines unworked, the sea unnavigated‚ and every one thought
his stock of knowledge enough. Time, penury, and experience worked
the cure, and taught language, agriculture, commerce, and the arts of
war and peace3 nay (to pass from more hackneyed topics)‚ taught divi·
nation, magic‚ and necromancy‚ and did not stop till they had mounted
up to heaven and studied nature's operationS‚ the causes of thundess
conflagrationS, earthquakeS‚ rain and wind, and the reason why winter
snow is soster than summer hail3 till the fiery bolt had been wrested
from Jove and transferred to the clouds, Hence came the knowledge
of the stars, the poet’s present subject, which he hopes to be permitted
to pursue through the gentle decline of a long life.

F irst he undertakes to describe the appearance of the universe,
glancing, as he passeS, at the various theories of its origin, chaotic or
atomic, Vulcanian or N eptunian‚ a problem which he seems to think
beyond divine no less than human comprehension. The upper part of
the mundane system is fire, next comes air, which serves as it were to
fan the flame: thirdly water, which in like manner feeds the air by its
exhalations: lastly earth, which occupies at once the lowest place and
the centre, the other elements falling off from it in equal proportions on
all sides, This balance of the earth preserves the regular succession of
day and night, the sun having space in which to circle round it. The
entire universe in fact is similarly balanced in the void, so· that the
earth is only following a higher example. The earth is not a plain buta
globe: so are the stara, and the sun and moon, the form being caused
