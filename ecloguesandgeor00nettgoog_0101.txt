THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. xcvii

a decided fondness for the forms and antiquities of the old Roman
worship. Taking the commentary as a whole, Ι am inclined to
characterize it as one of the works which, like the Saturnalia of
MacrobiuS, marks the reaction in favour of the past, which took place
among the Roman literati at the end of the fourth and the beginning of
the fifth centuries ΑΛ).

The commentary of Servius may, so far as its tone is concerned,
almost deserve the name of classical‚ for it is clear that in the main it
is constructed out of very ancient materials. For his information on
points of history and antiquities Servius drawS, very likely at second
or third hand, on Cato, Varro, Nigidius, and other authors of the same
stamp: for mythology on Hyginus, for grammar and philology on Varro
and Verrius Flaccus. The views of these writers he probably learned
from the scholars of the end of the first and beginning of the second
centurieS, as Asper and ProbuS, and the writers of the time of Trajan,
Hadrian, and the Antonines. He quoteS, indeed, writers of the third
and fourth centurie3‚ as Sammonicus SerenuS‚ Juba, SolinuS, Terentianus
MauruS, Statius Tullianus, TitianuS, and Catulinus ‚- but since the age of
the AntonineS, if we may judge by the original remarks of so celebrated
a scholar as Aelius Donatus (see on p. xcii), little if anything that was
both new and true had been added to Latin scholarship.

Of Titianus and Catulinus a word or two must be said before
we leave this part of our subject. On Aen. x 18 Servius mentions these
writers as the authors of a treatise which might in modern phraseology
be entitled Virgil as a Rhetorician ε ‘ Titianus et Catulinus, qui
themata omnia de Vergilio elicuerunt ad dicendi usum.' A fact most
important as illustrating the decline both of scholarship and education.
The cun-iculum of education is becoming more and more 'limited
to the study of Virgil 3 the study of Virgil is becoming more and more
scholastic and technical. Are there any actual remains of these base
and degenerate efforts of analysis? The fourth book of Macrobius
is an excellent specimen of what this method could effect. A mere
fragment of the book remainS‚ in which a thousand and one instances are
given of Virgil’s command over the resources of pathos. I have noticed
a great many similar remarks in the commentary of ServiuS, of which the
following may be taken as specimens:

A. ιν 31, et suasoria est omni parte plena: nam et purgat obiecta
et ostendit utilitatem et a timore persuadet. Et usus est apto causae
principi0, nam et cum aliquid propter nos petimuS, benevolum nobis
eum qui audit facere debemus, etc.

A. ιν 361, oratorie ibi finivit ubi vis argumenti constitit.

A. vr 104, sane sciendum adlocutionem hanc esse suasoriam cum
partibus suis.

A. vn 535, rhetorice viles trudit in medium; nobiles vero primo et
ultimo commemorat loco.

A. vm 127, et est rhetorica persuasio, nam principium ex utriusque
persona sumpsit.

A. vul 374, sane hoc rhetorica suasio est, nam principatum a
verecundia sumpsit.
