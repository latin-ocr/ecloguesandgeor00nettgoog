15. The later editors suppose the griev-
ance to have been that Amaryllis was
scornsul, Menalcas swarthy; but Corydon
obviously contrasts the scorn of Alexis
with that of his two former favourites, his
passion for whom of course he wishes to
paint strongly, anticipating an objection
that Menalcas at least could not be put
into comparison with Alexis, as being sar
less beautiful. The next lines accordingly
are a sort of apolog f⁰.¹' dark beauty, hke
that in x 39. ”““’”“”

16. ‘Essesz’ the tense refers properly
to MenalcaS, the former love, not to
Alexis, though Virg., for brevity, ex-
presses himself as if both had been objects
of Corydon‘s affection at the same time.

‘ Quamvis ’ qualifies the two adjectiveS,
‘ however black, however sair.'

' 17. ‘ Color‚' beauty‚ as consisti in
colour. ‘ Nullus argento color est,’ or.
Od. 11 ii 1.

18. ⁴ Ligustra,’ privet.

‘ Vaccima': Voss ingeniously supposes
‘ vaccinium ' and ὑάκινθος to be the same
word, [but this hardly agrees with 111 62,
‘suave rubens hyacinthus.' Others sug-
gest the whortleberry, the Vaccinium
myrtillus of Linnaeus, but this has light-
coloured flowers‚ is rare in Italy, and
hardly suits either v. f50, x 38, or Pliny
XVI 77, who speaks o it as a good-sized
shrub growing on wet ground. Its identifi-
cation appears hopeless: see Bubani‚ Flora
Virgiliana, p. 1213 Gerard’s Herbal, p.
¹41 ].

⁸ Cadunt,’ are lest to fall. Compare the

use of ‘ iacent,’ are allowed to lie without “

being picked up.

suppose with Keightley that, in falling
into the Cyclops' anguage, he is really
thinking of the advantage he gets from
having so much under his charge.

21. ‘ Mille meae agnae,' not ‘a thou-
sand os my lambS,’ as Wagn. thinks, but
‘ a thousand lambs os mine ' (Forb.).

22. Theocr. instead os rennial milk

year round ' (XVagn.), but ⁴ milk does not
fail me even at the most trying times 3 in
summer when “ lac praecipit aestus '’ (111
98), or in winter, which is the lamb'
season.' [Pal. has ‘lact,' aform mention
by Varro, L. L. v 104, etc.—H. N.]

23. ‘Vocabat,’ piped them home from

passage in Apoll. Rhod. 1 575 ε
