, INTRODUCTION. 1 1

Such a systematic confusion of time, place, and circumstance,
it will be readily admitted, goes sar to justify the way in which
Virgil has been spoken of in the opening of this essay as the
great corrupter of pastoral poetry, if by pastoral poetry is meant
a truthful dramatic representation os one of the simplest forms
os life. How far it vitiates the character of the Eclogues as pure
poetry, irrespective of the class to which they profess to belong,
is a further question, and one which ought not to be decided till
we have seen how much it may involve. If the Eclogues are to
be condemned on this ground, it is hard to see how we are to
excuse a work like Cymbeline. Is the somewhat broad shield
of the romantic drama is sufficient to cover the latter, room may
perhaps be found under it for the former. No incongruity of
which Virgil has been guilty can be so glaring or so fatal to
those notions os reality which the very form of historical know-
ledge suggests as that produced by the juxtaposition of the
modern Italian, not only with the legendary Briton, but with the
Roman of the earlier empire. It is not that the laws of time
and circumstance are simply violated, but that they are violated

. in such a way that the result appears to us inconceivable as well

as false, two typeS, belonging to different periods os the same
nation, and as such forming the subjects os an obvious historical
contrast, being imagined for the moment to co·exist, not in the
other world, as in the various Dialogues of the Dead, where this
incongruity enters into the very idea of the composition, but in
a world which, if not our own, resembles it in all its essential
features as a theatre for human action and passion. Yet criticism
seems now to be agreed that the very glaringness of such incon-
gruitieS, though doubtless attributable as much to ignorance or
recklessness as to any profound design, ought only to teach us
to divest ourselves os all extraneous prepossessions, and examine
the piece as a representation of human nature apart from the
conditions of time, just as when we look at some of the early ·
paintings our sense of beauty need not be ultimately disturbed ·
by our consciousness that the actions portrayed in the two parts
of the picture are obviously not simultaneous but successive. ·
Virgil, of course, according to our ordinary nomenclature, is a
classical. not a romantic poet; but the fact will hardly be held
