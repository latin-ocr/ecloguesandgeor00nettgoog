THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lv

daedala Circe because Lucretius had said daedala tellus. It seems from
this that Verrius must have had an article in which the daedala tellus of
Lucretius and the daedala Circe of Virgil were quoted together. The
case was probably similar (2) with Verrius' article on camums. F est
p. 43 says camara and camurt boves a curvatione ex Graeco κάμπη dicuntur.
Nonius, p. 30, has the following note: camurum obtortum, unde et
camerae tecta in curvitatem formata. Vergilius Georgicorum lib. 111
(v. 55), ‘Et camuris hirtae sub cornibus aures! Commenting on this
line Macrobius vl iv 23 says camurus peregrinum verbum est, id est in
se redeuntibus, Et forte nos quoque camaram hac ratione figuravimus.
Servius, in his note on the passage of the third Georgic, sayS, camuris, id
est curmle. Unde et camerac appellantur, and Philargyrius brings us very
near to the gloss in Paulus, camari boves sunt qui conversa introrsus
cornua habent. I conjecture that these remarks all represent parts of a full
note in Verrius Flaccus, in which canturi boves, camurae aures, and camera
were discussed together. (3) On p. 206 Festus has a note on petulcus
which he illustrates from Virgil's fourth Georgic (haedique petulci), from '
Lucretius, and from Afranius. It is instructive to find that MacrobiuS,
in his comment on the line in the fourth Georgic, also quotes the same
line of Lucretius in illustration of the word.

I have little doubt that had the work of Verrius De Verborum Signi-
ficatu been preserved in its original extent, it would be possible to
multiply these examples of comments drawn from articles in his lexicon
in which Virgil was quoted. It is much easier to collect instances in
which the De Verborum Significatu was used by late commentators for
general purposes of illustration. ( 1) Take for instance the note in
Festus p. 298 on the word summussi. Summussi dicebantur murmura-
tores. Naevius. ‘Odi, inquit, summussos; proinde aperte dice, quid
siet quod times! Ennius m sexto Annalium: ‘Intus m occulto mussa-
bant,' et Ennius ιιι Andromache . . ‚Mussare silere est: nam [Iuven-
tius in Anagnorizomene], ‘quod potes sile cela occulta tege tace mussa
mane! Philargyrius on Georg.1v 188, mussant· hic murmurant.
Quae vox ponitur in tacendi significatione, ut apud Ennium in xvn,

‘non possunt mussare boni qui facta labore Nixi militiae peperere?
Interdum autem pro dubeto, ut (A. xn 657) ‘mussat rex ipse LatinuS,
Quos generos vocet? Musitant autem murmurant. Ennius m x sic ait,

‘Expectans si mussaret quae denique pausa Pugnandi fieret.' Serv· A.
xu 657 mussat, modo dubitat; Dan. adds, . ‚Veteres mussat pro
timet. Ennius mussare pro tacere posuit. Clodius Tuscus: ‘mussare
est ex Graeco; comprimere oculos Graeci μῦσαι dicunt) And NoniuS,
p. 42 7, distinguishes mussare and murmurare.

(2) PauluS, p. 368, on vescus. Vescus fastidiosus, Vc enim pro
pusillo utebantur. Lucretius vaccum dixit edacem, cum ait ‘ nec mare
quae impendent vesco sale saxa peresa. Gellius xvr v 6 has words to
the same effect, but NoniuS, p. 186, seems to preserve a better form of
this gloss, in which it is clear that Paulus or Festus have confused
quotation and interpretation. Viescum minutum, obscurum. Lucilius
lib. xxw‘ quamfastidiosum ac vescum cum F alcrdro videre! Vergilius
Georgicorum lib. 111 (175)‘ nec vescas salicum frondes! Afranius in
