aut asper crabro inparibus se inmiscuit armis,

P. VERGILI MARONlS

245

aut dirum, tiniae, genuS, aut invisa Minervae
laxos in foribus suspendit aranea casses,

quo magis exhaustae fuerint, hoc acrius omnes
incumbent generis lapsi sarcire ruinas,

complebuntque foros et floribus horrea texent.

Si vero, quoniam casus apibus quoque nostros
vita tulit, tristi languebunt corpora morbo ;—
quod iam non dubiis poteris cognoscere signis:
continuo est aegris alius color; horrida voltum

βίοτον νήποινον ἔδουσιν (spoken of the
Suitors), as Germ. remarks.

‘ Sedens ad pabula,’ like ‘ sedere ad
focum‚' ‘ad gubernacula,' etc. Med.
originally had ⁸ ad poeula.‘

245. ‘Armis' is not, as seems to be
generally thought, the abl„ but the

‘Texent ' perhaps is used to recall the
image osweaving actual flowerS, though of
course the meaning is that they construet
their cells with pollen from flowers, ‘ flori·
bus,’ [or rather with the bee-glue‚ which
virgil thought to consist partly of pollen.
See the explanation in the note on v. 38

dative, as appears from A. x 796, Χῖ 815, above, ‘ fisco et floribus-’J

where ‘se mmiscuit armis ’ recur. ⁸ ln-
paribus' then refers to the ‘ill-matched’
army of the beeS, which cannot eope with
a homet. ‘Paribus armis ’ is used A. v
42 5 of equal wea ns.

246. See v· ι . ‘ Tiniae ' are coupled
with ‘ blattae,’ Hor. S. 11 iii 119.

‘Dirum ι ’ the early editors gave ‘du-
rum ' after some inferior MSS„ including
one of Ribbeek’s cursives [and Nonius}

‘ Invisa Minervae ’ refers to the legend
os Arachne; Ovifl Μ. vt 1-140.

248·25⁰· [Ribbeck, Thilo and others
insert these lines before 239.]

248. These words contain a precept,
which the rustic writers sanction, not to
leave too much honey, lest the bees should
become idle. Cerda comp. a similar re-
csseptd(Aristot. H. A. 1x 40), not to kil all

Hist. 11 10, on analogy of ‘ studeo-³ See
11 46, ‘ accingar dieere,' and note.]

. ⁶ Lapsi generis ¹ recalls the notion of ‘a
human family, as v. 208.

250. ‘ Foros’ [‘passages’ (H. N.), the
usual sense. Con. took it to mean ⁸ rows
os oe115,’ but admitted there was no parallel
sor this sense. It is, however, accepted

by several editors]

of the easinaes ofFrognostication ends to
