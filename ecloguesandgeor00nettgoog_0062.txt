lviii THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

tenus . . . maxime finem terminumque designat. It is, however, at
least as probable that both Modestus and Nonius owed their informa·
tion to Verrius Flaccus, for in Festus, p. 367, we read tenus significat
finem, ut cum dicimus hactenus. And more of this note on tenus Ι
suspect is to be found in the note of Servius on Aen. v1 62, hactenus,
hucusque: id est hic sit finis. Nam tenus est proprie extrema pars
arcuS, ut Plautus ostendit (Bacch. lv vi 23) ‘ita intendi tenu5,’ unde
tractum est ut hactenus hucusque significet. However the case may really
have stood, we have here again, as in the instance of the note on bidem,
a valuable specimen of the scholarship of the Aug-ustan age.

5. L. ANNAEUS CORNUTUS.

CornutuS, the contemporary and friend of Silius Italicus, and the
revered tutor of PersiuS, was banished by Nero A.D. 68. He was the
author of commentarii AeneidOS, which are mentioned by CharisiuS,
pp. 100 and 102, and apparently of remarks on the EclogueS. A few
of his notes are quoted in the Verona scholia and in the commentary of
Servius, In Aen. 1 45, he would have preferred ‘inflixit’ to ‘infixit’ as
more forcible (vehementius): in Aen. 1 150, he defended volam¹ against
volunt, and in Aen. lx 348, he read for ‘ multa morte recepit’ ‘ multa
nocte recepit! These specimens do not impress us very deeply with a
sense of his critical power3 nor does he always appear to much advan-
tage as an interpreter. In Aen. lx 675, for instance, he took ‘com-
missa ' as equivalent to ‘ clausa' 3 an interpretation improbable in itself‚
and which is wholly ignored in the note on this passage in Nonius
p. 249. A few other notes of Cornutus, hardly worth quoting here,
may be found in Servius and the Verona scholia.

Several objections of his to points of detail in Virgil's language and
in his management of his story have been preserved by Gellius and
Macrobius, He took exception to the word vexasse in Ecl. vr 76,
where Servius appeals to Probus in the poet’s defence (comp. Gell. 11 6).
He found fault with the conclusion of the fourth Aeneid: ‘unde haec
historia, ut crinis auferendus sit morientibu5‚ ignoratur,' are his words
quoted in Macrobius v xix 2. It was naturally replied that Virgil was
simply following the Alcestis of Euripides. Not much more attention
need be paid to his complaint that Virgil in Aen. v 488 has made
Aeneas shoot a bird sacred to his own mother, or to his criticisms
(preserved by Gellius lx 10) of the wording of Aeneid vm 405.

6. AEMILIUS ASPER.¹

It is uncertain whether this distinguished scholar lived before or
after Probus. The fact that no mention is made of him by Suetonius

in his work De Illustribus Grammaticis makes very strongly in favour

Cornutus, et alii innumerabiles requiruntur ut quilibet poeta possit intenegi,’ says
Augustine, Util. Cred. ἓ 17. [Idimmerhirt in Commentationes hil. lenenses iv 401
argues that Asper lived about the end of the second century tuuf
