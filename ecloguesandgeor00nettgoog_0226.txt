P. VERGILI MARONIS

Naide5‚ indigno cum Gallus amore peribat? ιο
narn neque Parnasi vobis iuga, narn neque Pindi
ulla moram fecere, neque Aonie Aganippe.

illum etiam lauri, etiam flevere myricae;

pinifer illum etiam sola sub rupe iacentem

Maenalus et gelidi fleverunt saxa Lycaei. 15
stant et oves circum ;-nostri nec paenitet illas,

nec te paeniteat pecoriS‚ divine poeta:

et formonsus ovis ad flumina pavit Adonis—

venit et upilio; tardi venere subulci;

10. ‘ Peribat’ Pal„ Rom. (which here
resumes after the lacuna), Med. corr.,
etc. ; ‘ periret’ Med„ Gud. corr„ ancl
other cursives. External evidence justi-
fies Wagn. in reading ‘peribat 3 ’ intrinsi-
cally either might stand. See Madv.
g 3:518on amore‚’ vri-1 18, note.

11. Τ e two mountains are mentioned,
as Heyne observes, with a reference to
the springs belonging to each.

12. ‘ Ulla ’ = ‘ ullo modo ' [so ‘ nulluS,’
‘totus,’ ‘omnis' in such usages as ‘is
nullus venit' (Plaut. As· 11 iv 2), ‘cum
· rogaberis nulla’ (Catuli. vm 14); see
Munro Lucr. 1 377, 11 53.]

‘Moram fecerez' ‘ fleret vento mora
ne‘ffgrfiirfrgalqzoriie &niglu-es, and Serv. ς
‘Aoniae' Med., Rom„ Gud., Charisius
and all other grammarianS, who however
read ‘ Aganippae ' also. Ribbeck accepts
‘ Aoniae ε ’ but it is more likely that the
Greek nominative was misunderstood by
copyists 3 it is the natural form in a metrical
licence like this, intended as imitation of
the Greek. So Sil. xiv 515, ‘Ortygie
Arethusa,’ which Heius. restored
scriptis ’ for ‘ Ortygiae Arethusae.'

13. From Theocr. 1 71, 72, where how·
ever the mourners are wolveS, jackaIS, and
lions, as in E. v 26. The neglect os the
nymphs is contrasted with the sorrow of
the trees and shmbs, which were vocal as
echoing to Gallus' lament, the bays being
introduced as in vl 83, the tamarisks as
in vr 10. Such an explanation of the
image was evidently in Virg.’s mind
(comp. v 62 note, vm 22 note), but he
does not put it forward prominently, as it
would interfere with the effect of the rest
os tlgg passage, where actual mourners are
intr ucecl.

‘ex

There are some variations in the rm
of the line. Rom. substitutes a ¹
‘ illum ’ for the second ‘etiarm’ which in
Gud. is written over an erasure3 another
of Ribbeck’s cursives reads ‘illum ’ with
⁸ etiam ’ written over it, apparently as an
insertion, not as a correction ; and ‘ illurn
etiam ¹ is found in the Lombard and a few
other MSS„ and was the old reading be-
fore Heius. [Probably the hiatus puzzled
the copyists.] Both language and rhythm
plead for the text as now received.

14. Comp. vm 22. ⁶ Sola sub rupe ; '
so Orpheus (G. lv 508, 509) ‘ru sub
aeria deserti ad Strymonis undam F evisse,
et gelidis haec evolvisse sub antris.'

15. ⁸ Lycaei,’ G. 1 16.

16. ‘ Nostri,' of us shepherds. The
sheep do not regret their connexion with
uS, and the best of us need not regret his
with them.

17. ‘ Nec te paeniteat,' 11 34 note.
Gallus is addraesed as if he had been a
shepherd, and so doubtless Virg. chooses
to regard him ι but the language here
seems intended to meet an objection that
the connexion might disgrace him, so that
the sense, stripped of metaphor, will be
‘ do not regret or think scorn of your
association with pastoral poetry.' [Rib-
beck chooses to bracket the line.]

‘ Divine poeta‚’ v 45, also os ashepherd.

18. From Theocr. 1 109, xx 33, where
however the connexion is quite different.
The thought here is like E. 11 60. [⁴ For·
monsus,' the best MSS—H. N.]

19. [‘ Upilio ’ is usually connected with
‘ opilio,' a shepherd (Plaut. As. 111 i 36,
Cato R. R. 10). The scansion of the two
words, however, differs: ‘ opilio ‘ has ἰ in
Pl„ and Serv. assigns it initial ὅ : ‘ propter
metrum ait, sicut οὕνομα pro ὄνομ’ No
satisfactory explanation of the two forms
