‘ Iugo referunt‚’ draw home. ‘ Versa iugo
referuntur aratra,' Ov. F. v 497, quoted
by Trapp.

‘ Suspensa,’ not going into the ground
(‘depressa'), but carried so as not to
touch it, as in the expression ‘suspenso

du ’—probably the same thing as

oraoe’s ‘vomerem inversum! The con-
trast express-ed here is probably from
Theocr. 11 38 foll. (Gebauer, . 171).

it is hinted, not directly expressed‚ with

73. 9Both the half-pruned vine and the

 

over-leasy elm would be signs of negli-
gence. Comp. G. 11 410, ‘bis vitibus
ingruit umbra.' An unpruned vine was a
scandal in ancient husbandry. Hor. S. 1
vii 31. VosS, reviving a notion of Serv„
sees an allusion to an alleged superstition,
