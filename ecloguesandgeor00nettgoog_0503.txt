The objection that ‘ illa’ is followed not
by ‘ hunc ’ but by ‘illum ’ may be met if
we consider that the contrast is ¹not meant
to be so much formally expressed as sug·
ested, her subseq'uent fate being lest to
inserted from er being seen floating
over the water.

‘ Nare ⁸ of sailing on board ship seems
rare. Fore. quotes Catull. vai 45, ‘ iu·

At on.'

‘ Iam,’ with ‘ frigida; ’ all the warmth
of life by this time had left her. Compare
the reason given by Lucian (De Luctu, 1 1)
for putting a robe on the dead body, viz.

‘Antris ε ’ Rom. has ‘astriS,' which is
exceedingly plausible, whether we inter-

and] poets are laced in caves elsewhere,
Prop. 1v i 5, ⁸ icite‚ quo pariter carmen
tenuastis in antr0,’ etc. 3 see Bentley on
Hor. Od. 1 xxxii 1. Thus ‘gelidis’would
have soree here as reminding us that caves

are not merely ⁸ places osnestling green sor
poets made,’ but have their dreary side,
which was here the attraction to Orpheus,

‘ Evolvisse,' recounted his sufferings in
order, a metaphor either from spinning or
from turning over a book.

510. The existence of tigers in Thrace
is of course a fanciful or mistaken notion.
Keightley remarks that Shakespeare talks
osa lioness in the ArdenneS.

511-515. The celebrated simile which
follows is compounded from od. xlx 518
foll. and ib. xvi 216 soll„ the former of
which passages describes the nightingale
si 'ng as i in lamentation for her lost
Ity us, while the latter speaks of vul-
tures screaming sor the real loss of their
young. [This is the only place in which
Virgil mentions the nightingale. His lines

are true to nature (see next note), as are ·

almost all his descriptions of birds, except
the half-m thical kingfisher, 111 338.]

511. [‘ opulea sub umbra ε ’ Virg.
‘ must have been thinkin of some scene
like thick serub along t e banks of the
streams near reedy Mantua: the plough·
man had discovered the nest in the serub
and the nightingale had retired to a poplar
branch to give voice to its grief or to spur
its mate to fresh exertionS. This passage
is probably a reminiscenee of some actual
experience in the t's boyhood.'—
W. Warde Fowler, ngses. Review iv 50,
who also describes a nightingale singing
in a poplar.]
