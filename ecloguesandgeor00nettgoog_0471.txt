228. ‘Angustam, Rom.; ‘a tam,’
Serv„ Med., Pal„ Gud., etc. T e latter
is to a certain extent confirmed by ‘ then-
sauris,’ though scarcely, as has been
thought, by the latter t of the sen·

between the grandeur of the abode of the
bees and the means recommended for

heroic contrast must be supposed between
the assumed importance of the bees and
the easiness of their capture, like that in
vv. 86, 87. Β111 011 the whole Wagn. and
Forb. seem right in preferring ⁶ angus-
tam,' which suits best with the simplicity
of a practical precept, and is not 111010-
vant to the process of rifling the hive.
[Ribbeck and Thilo read ⁸ augustam.']

opening jars by undoing the pitch with
which they were fastened. ‘ Relevi dolia

‘ves ‘ thensauri‚' which Ribbeck adopts.
The spelling ‘ them-’is attested here by
Pal. Rom. Gud., in A. 1 359 by Med.
Rom„ and accepted by Ribbeck and
Nettleship. 1t occurs also in MSS. of
Plautus, Sallust, etc„ and on inscriptione,

229, 230. Col. lx 14 sa s that the person
who takes the honey ought to have bathed

and to have abstatned from things that
taint the breath. It is natural then (with
Wund.) to take ‘ ora fove ' of rinsing the
mouth, the process being the same as
in fomentation, though the object is dif-
ferent. In⁸11 135 ‘ora fovent’ denotes

difficulty, has doubtless a quasi-middle
force, while its application is limited by
‘ ora' and ‘haustu

The text of the sentence is disputed.
In 229 the best MSS. have ‘haustu’

‹(Med. oriffial‘ly ‘astu ’). In 230 Med.

Serv. and the Berne scholia mention both
readings, but prefer ‘ ore fove.’ ‘ Ora fove '
is found in 211 0211 corr. of Med: and in
some cursives, 211 , as explained above,
seems satisfactory. But Ribbeck may be
right 111 accepting ⁸ ore fove,’ though (as
he admits) he does so ‘ magis auctoritatem
librorum quam sententiae incertissimae
indicia secutus. ' [Others accept ‘ ore fave,'
keep silence.]
