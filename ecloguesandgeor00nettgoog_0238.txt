130 ΟΝ THE LATER

wishes for her back on any terms‚ and bethinks himself of sending her
a poetical entreaty, which 10135 good-naturedly offers to convey. It is
accordingly recited by Lycidas, and taken down by Iolas on cherry·
bark—a piteous composition, describing the lover's desolate condition,
reminding Phyllis of her past pleasure in his society, comparing his
personal attractions and his wealth with those of Mopsus, offering to
let her bind his vindictive hands—hands which nevertheless had given
her many presents—sneering at Mopsus’ poverty, and finally threatening
that the lover will hang himself in the event of reJ'ection from the tree
which first made him jealouS. 10135 promises to report it, and is
rewarded at the same moment by the sight of his heifer‚ which he kindly
sets down as an omen of his friend's success

The fourth Eclogue, Caesar, is again political. MeliboeuS, the
shepherd-poet's patron, finds Corydon meditating a more than rustic
song in praise of Caesar, a design in which his younger brother Amyntas
is also anxious to join. The patron reminds Corydon that he had often
warned his brother against the thriftless occupation of singing, and is
told that it is his own kindness which 1135 placed them both above want,
and 1135 given them the means of thinking of such pursuits. As the
lines may, perhaps, possess some biographical interest, though the images
are obviously borrowed from Virgil's first Eclogue, it may be worth while
to quote them, by way of a specimen of the poet’s manner:

non eadem nobis sunt tempora, non Deus idem ι
5ρο5 magis adridet. certe 00 fraga rubosque
colligerem, viridique famem solarer hibisco,

tu facis, et tua 005 alit indulgentia farre.

tu, nostras miseratus opes docilemque iuventam,
hiberna prohibes ieiunia solvere fago.

ecce nihil querulum per te, Meliboee, 5003111115,
per te secura saturi recubamus 10 umbra,

et fruimur silvis Amaryllidos, ultima nuper
litora terrarum, nisi tu, Meliboee, fuisses,
ultima visuri, trucibusque obnoxia Mauris
pascua Geryonis, liquidis ubi cursibus ingens
dicitur occiduas impellere Baetis harenas.
scilicet extremo nunc vilis in orbe iacerem,

a dolor! et pecudes inter conductus Iberas
inrita septena modularer sibila canna,

nec quisquam nostras inter dumeta Camenas
respiceret, non ipse daret mihi forsitan aurem,
ipse DeuS, vacuam, longeque sonantia vota
scilicet extremo 000 exaudiret in orbe.’
