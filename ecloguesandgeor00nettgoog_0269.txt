skill, using care to sharpen men's witS, nor letting the realm
which he had made his own grow dull under the weight of ’
lethargy. Then carne the divers arts of life: so Toil conquered
the world, relentless Toil, and Want that grinds in adversity.
The acorns had begun to fail in the sacred forests and Dodona
to withhold her sustenance, when Ceres taught men to plough
and SOW. Soon the corn itsels had hardship and sickness laid
upon it: those plagues came in which gave the farmer no respite,
and, if he relaxes his vigilance, drive him back into a barbarism
which resembles the golden age only in what it is without.
‘ Unless your rake is ever ready to exterminate weedS, your
shout to scare away birds, your hook to restrain the shade
which darkens the land, and your prayers to call down rain,
poor man, you will gaze on your neighbour’s big heap of grain
with unavailing envy, betake yourself to the woods again, and
shake the oak to allay your hunger.' The same indomitable
enthusiasm animates the poet, when, with the Second Book, a
fresh division of his subject opens upon him. In a second
invocation he sees himself and Bacchus as fellow-labourerS,
taking part in every detail of the vintage. ‘Come hither, Father
of the winepress! strip off thy buskinS, bare thy legS, and plunge
them with me in the new must.’ He surveys his new province
in all its length and breadth 3 and the result is a fresh access of
¹exulting energy. ‘ Come then, husbandmen, and learn the
culture proper to each according to its kind, and so mellow your
wild fruits by cultivation, nor let the ground lie idle. What joy
to plant Ismarusall over with the progeny of the wine-god, and
clothe the mighty sides of Taburnus with a garment of olives! '
No jot of the difficulty is abated or omitted: the objects of
,labour are mountainS, which themselves suggest the notion of an
,arduous undertaking: but the planting is to be thorough, the
clothing entire: and the reward is to be found in the work
itself—that the wine-god should be propagated by human aid
—that the weaving of so vast a robe should be in human hands,
But the poet is a worker too, His task is to instruct the
labourer in his manifold dutieS, and record his manifold triumphS.
He has launched his bark, and must perform the voyage; and
he calls on his patron to stand at his side, and spread with him
