xxii LIFE OF VIRGIL.

occupied him nine yearS, is said in a notice preserved by Philargyrius
to have given the occasion for Horace’s precept ‘ nonumque prematur in
annum.’ We may conjecture that he was admired by Virgil as setting
an example of severe learning and minute study of form. Varius may
have inspired Virgil with the love of epic and tragedy. It is curious
that before he began the Eclogues he attempted a poem on Roman
history, but found the subject uncongenial to his then frame of mind.1

The Ciceronian age, barren of epic, tragedy, and comedy‚ had pro-
duced only lyric, didactic‚ and learned poetry. Virgil's youth was
passed under the direct influence of the Alexandrian school and its
followers in Italy; with Cornelius Gallus, one of the most distinguished
among the ‘ cantores EuphorioniS,’ he was on terms of intimate friend-
ship.8 It is remarkable how Virgil's genius and tact enabled him to
avoid the characteristic faults of the Alexandrians and their imitatorS.
Non hic te carmine ficto Atque per ambages et longa exorsa tenebo, Their
merits he makes his own, their refinement and their beauty; but there
is nothing to show that he had ever any taste for the obscurity and
affectation and love of recondite mythology which Catullus and
Propertius and probably Cinna allowed to blemish much of their
writing.

Before the year 41 ac„ Virgil had been fortunate enough to win the
friendship of Asinius Pollio,³ whom he mentions in the third Eclogue
as encouraging his attempts in the way of pastoral poetry, as well as
that of Cornelius Gallus and Alfenus Varus, Pollio was legatus in Gallia
Cisalpina in 43 B.c.; whether Virgil knew him before this is not
certain. When the troubles of the year 41 came, and Virgil, like
Propertius and Tibuuus, was ejected from his estate, the influence of
these three friends procured its restitution from OctavianuS, who found
it a hard task to silence the complaints of the eJected landowners‚
without giving dangerous offence to his veterans.⁴>

In the quar-rel which attended Virgil's expulsion from liis farm he
was aided by the wealthy and accomplished Etruscan eques, C. Cilnius
Maecenas, with whom he had previously been acquainted, and was
afterwards on terms of intimate friendship.³ The Eclogues, published
