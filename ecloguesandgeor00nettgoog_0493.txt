set quanto ille magis formas se vertet in omnis,
tant0‚ nate, magis contende tenacia vincla,
donec talis erit mutato corpore, qualem
videri3‚ incepto tegeret cum lumina somno!

Haec ait, et liquidum ambrosiae diffundit odorem, 415
quo totum nati corpus perduxit; at illi
dulcis compositis spiravit crinibus aura,

41¹· Pal. has ‘vertit‚' and so one or
two of Ribbeck’s cursives. [⁸ Set ’ Med.
and the St. Gall fragm—H. N.]

412. ‘ Contende tenacia vincla ' is
Virg.'s nivalent for Hom. 's μᾶλλον
πιέζειν. erv- οη v. 400 gives an alle·
gorical explanation of the binding of Pro·
teuS, ending with these words: ‘ unde
sacerdotem hunc dicit tunc posse vaticinari
et suscipere divinitatem, cum religata in
eo fuerit ignea cupiditaS, silvestris aspe-

‘ ritas, lapsus animi, aquarum mobilitati

similis’ Pal. and originally Med. and
Gud. have ‘tantu ε’ Serv. says ‘alii
legunt tam tu.' which Ribbeck accepts
and sup to have been read by Dona·
tus on er. Hec. 111 iv 3.

413. Eidothea tells Ulysses to loose
Proteus ὅτε κεν δὴ α’ αὐτὸς ἀνείρηται ἐπέ·
mcv, Τοῖος ἐών, οἶόν κε κατευνηθέντα
ἴδησθε. Ovid (M. xx 253), in a passage
studied after Virg. and Hom„ makes
Proteus himself, ‘ Carpathius medio de
gurgite vates,' give similar advice to
Peleus about gaining possession of Thetis,
⁸ N ec te decipiat centum mentita figura,
Sed preme quidquid erit, dum quod fuit
ante reformet.'

414. ‘Tegeret lumina somno' is a
mss suffusus...

ambrosia, she then took him to a sea-cave
which Proteus haunted‚ and placed him
in the shade, herself invisible. At mid-
day Proteus came from the sea, and
having counted his seaIS, laid himself
down, when-Aristaeus rushed on him, and
{¹1} {Piiin‘g ιῗέῗιιῗὲαῖῗὲῗιῗὲἓὲῗίιῗέιοέἱῗρῐῗ
The god asked why he had come. Aris·
taeus replied that there was no need
to tell him what he knew already. T hen
Protglus’began to tell him the cause of his
trou e.

415· In this h, as in the last,
Virg. follows ffimt ough with some

variety in the circumstances. Menelaus
has an ap lication of ambrosia, not to his
whole y, but to his nostrils, and that
for a homely matter-of·fact reason, to osser-
{³331}sswilffssztfsffixs. {3 {⁷553
invi orate Aristaeus for lus struggle.
Vffhat Virg.’s conception os ambrosia
was is not clear. In Hom. it is a sub·
stance which the gods eat (od. v 93), and
with which they purify their bodies (ΙΙ.
xiv 170). Virg. talks os its odour in A.
1 4033 in ΧΠ 419 its juice is brought by
Venus to be used medicinally. In the
i'nriepsaeltptab e pefffumag &oniti ἐατῗὲξ, ῑῗιὲ
context, and would seem the most natural
way of explaining the present line in par·
ticular. [⁸ Liquidum' may = pure—H.
N.] If the word ‘perduxit and the
authori of Homer be held to prove that
it must
be actually rubbed on the
must choose between (1) regarding ‘li-
quidum diffundit odorem ' as equivalent
to ⁸ diffundit odoratum liquorem,' ‘dif-
fundit ’ being nearly the same as ‘per-
duxit,’ which seems to be the common

interpretation, and (2) suplposmg that
Cyrene is said to make the air ragrant with
the ambrosia with which she proceeds to
anoint her son, as if she had opened
some casket, which sent forth a perfume
at once before its contents were touched.

[Rom. has ‘ambrosia'-—H. N.]. Rib-
beck reads ‘defundit' from the St. Gall
palimpsest. Pal. has ‘ perfundit,' Rom.
‘ depromit,' reading ⁶ perfudit ' in the
next line for ‘ perduxit,’ a carious variety.

416. With ‘ quo totum nati corpus
perduxit ’ comp. Pers. 11 56, ⁸ auro sacras
quod ovato Perducis facies?

417. ‘ Compositis’ seems to imply that
his hair was arranged at the time when
the perfume was imparted, if not by the
same process

[⁸Aura’ofodour,asLucr. n 851, Martial
111 652, ιτα-Η. Ν.] Rom. has ‘auras’
