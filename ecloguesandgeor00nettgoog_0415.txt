volneribus crebris; lavit ater. corpora sangine,
versaque in obnixos urgentur cornua vasto .

cum gemitu3 reboant silvaeque et longus Olympus,
nec mos bellantis una stabulare3 sed alter

victus abit, longeque ignotis exulat oriS,

225

multa gemens ignominiam plagasque superbi
victoriS, tum, quos amisit inultuS, amores;
et stabula aspectans regnis excessit avitis
ergo omni cura vires exercet, et inter

dura iacet pernix instrato saxa cubili,

230

frondibus hirsutis et carice pastus acuta,
et temptat sese, atque irasci in cornua discit

221. [‘Lavit’ Nonius pp. 466, 503,
l'hilarg. and all the uncials; in Med.
‘lavit is corrected into ‘ lavat! For
sssssffig', Ιέἱουὲιε] PP· 337, ,⁴⁶⁶ has

222, ἦν δὲ μετώπων ὀλόεντα πλήγματα
καὶ στόνος ἀμφοῖν, Soph. l. c. ‘ GemituS‚’
like στόνος, seems to refer to the bellow-
ing oglthe ζὲῐηῑὶῖιαῑωιῐε. hlt ngigtllif als-{¹0 con·
ceiva e cras o e oms;
⁴ gemerye' is used v. 183 of the noise os
wheels. [⁴ Ur entur' rat—H. N.]

223. Med. as ‘resonum' but this
would clearly be inferior.

‘Longus' ¹(Met-l. and Macrob. Sat.
vl 4) was rightly restored by Burm.
The common reading was ‘ magnus ⁹
(Pal. Rom. ). It is a translation of
Hom. ’s μακρὸς Ὀλυμποςε Virg. how·
ever, as Heyne remarkS‚ merely means
⁸ Olympus ’ as a synonym sor heaven,
so that ‘longus' is to be explained by
‘ reboant)

224. The elevation of the language
leads Keightley to suggest that Virg.
may have had in his mind the withdrawal
into banishment os some defeated public
man. Lucan. 11 601 and Stat. Theb. 11
323, who imitate the e, use the
image as a simile for the retirement of
their heroes, Pompey and Polynices·

‘ Stabulare,’ intrans. A. VI 286, etc. ;
Varro 1 21 uses the word actively [Neue-
Wagener, Formenlehre ii p. 92].

[⁸ Set ⁹ Med. ‘ Sed ’ Pal. Rom—H. N.]

227. ·‘ Amores‚' of the beloved object,
Catull. va 1, ‘ Acmen, suos amores!

228. The action of this line precedes
that of v. 225, as is marked by the change
os tense. Thus, as ⁸ tum ’ show5, Keightley

is wrong ιι) connecting· ‘ amores ’ with
vaisggcfffcscordyiiigthtdhgnemffizrgcrjgigtiolii}
and with ‘regnis avitis’ E. 1 70. ‘A
wistsul look at his stall, and the king has
quitted his ancestral domain.’

[‘Ads ctans ' Rom.—H. N.]

230. ‘ Pernix :’ so Med. Pal. Rom.
Gud., Nonius p. 358, Senr. Philarg.
Schol. Bern.‚ followed by Ribbeck. It
means here, as Nonius explains it, ‘ per·
severans) Phila . mentions a variant
‘ pernox,' given ffiso by Schol. Iuv. vu
10 and one or two inferior MSS..
which ’was ‘preferred by Con. and others
²⁵ 532‘35455‘22022385123 ⁰”3diff'1'mfiss'trffil1 2
so ἄστρωτος is used th of the rougb
ground (Eur. Herc. F. 52) and os those
who sleep on it (Plato Polit. 272). The
word seems to occur nowhere else. Others
make it part. of ‘insterno ' (comp. Lucr.
v 987 ¹ instrata cubilia fronde’)‚ i. e.
‘ spread on the rocks? though ‘ spread
with ’ is the usual sense.

232. ‘ Irasci in cornua temptat,’ A. ΧΠ
104. The words are from Eur. Bacch. 732,
ταῦροι . . εἰς κέρας θυμούμενοι, and are prob·
ably to be explained with Voss as if the bull
were throwing his anger into his horns.
So ov. Μ. v111 882, ‘vires in cornua
sum0.' But it is not easy to analyze the
expression, or to be certain that Eur. and
Virg. meant exactly the same thing: εἰς
κέρας might be explained as denoting the
object, εἰς μάχην κεράτωνε ‘in cornua’
might be framed on the analogy of ‘in
speciem‚’ etc„ as a modal accusative, so
that ‘irasci in cornua ' would virtually =
‘ irasci cornibus.' ·
