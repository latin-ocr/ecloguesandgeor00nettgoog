BucoLch. EcL. 1. 27

verum haec tantum alias inter caput extulit urbes,
quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi. 25
Et quae tanta fuit Romam tibi causa videndi?
Libertas, quae sera, tamen respexit inertem,
candidior postquam tondenti barba cadebat;

respexit tamen et longo post ternpore venit,
postquam nos Amaryllis habet, Galatea reliquit. 30
namque, fatebor enim, dum me Galatea tenebat,

nec spes libertatis erat nec cura peculi.
