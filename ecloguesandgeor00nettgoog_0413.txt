198. ‘Tum ’ may be either correlative
to ‘ cum,’ v. 196, or a particle of transition,
as apparently in other similes (e. g. A. XI
7243 xn 591). The parallel of A. 1 148,
{132 ’.2211333 ²1¹3.ssssssss ³b‘yh5‘5u1202‘v331‘3‘
stitutes the point os the comparison, which
is not here the case. It is sasest to say
that here ‘tum ' does not mean definitely
either ‘at that moment,’ or ‘next,' but
denotes generally that the action which
follows belongs to the same time as that
which precedes,
⁸ Campi natantes ' is from Lucr. v 4883
vx 267, [405, 11423 like ‘campi liquente&
A. vt 724, it = the sea3 comp. ‘campi

had in view two similes of Homer Il. 11

of the gale. ‘Tarde primum clementi
flamine pulsae (undae) Procedant,' Catull.

‘ Sonor ’ is Lucretian.
200. ⁸ Resonantia longe Litora misceri,
et nemorum increbrescere murmur’ is a
rognostic of wind 1 358. ‘ Longi fluctus,’
ong wavae, denotes the force of the winds.
Heyne wrongly renders it, ‘qui longe, e
lonlginqum veniunt.’ [⁴ Urguent' Rom.

201. Comp. ιν 174, ‘Illi inter sese
magna vi bracchia tollunt In numerum,
versantque tenaci forcipe ferrum3’ A. 1
153, ‘Ille regit dictis animos et pectora
mulcet,’ where the simile is concluded
similarly by a return to the original
subject of it—in this case, the north
wind.

202. ‘Hicz' Med„ fragm. Aug., re-
stored by W ner: ‘a horse like this.'
Med. corn, at. fragm„ Rom„ have

has little to do with the horse, is supposed
to have impressed the reader with his high

have been expressed„ ⁸ ad metas per cam·

evidently an imitation. ‘S atia,' 1 513.
⁸ Spumas aget,’ Lucr. 111 482.

‘ Cruentas: ’ from the bit against which
he pulls, showing his spirit (Keightley). So
Aesch. Ag. 1067, πρὶν αἱματηρὸν ἐξαφρί·
ἵζεσθαι μένος, a metaphor from a horse
being broken in. ·

204. Virg. probably refers to the em-
ployrnent of highbred horses in drawing
the carriages (⁸ esseda ') of the rich (Keight-
ley). The ‘ essedum’ was properly the
British war-chariot‚ and is so mentioned
by Caesar and Cicer0, but it had been
recently introduced into Rome as a carriage
(Cic. Au. vl i 253 Phil. 11 xxiv 58). o
Prop. 11 i 86 (of Maecenas) ‘ esseda
caelatis siste Britanna iugis’ and Sil. 111
337 (imitating Virg.) ‘aut molli pacata
celer rapit esseda collo)

‘ Belgica‚' instead of British. So Pers.
vl 47 calls the ‘esseda' German. Pal.
and Med. (originally) have ,ι Bellica.’

‘ Feret ’ seems to refer to the wearing of
the yoke on the neck. Fragm. Aug.
apparently has ‘ ferat.’

205. ‘ Farrago’ [mixed green food sor
cattle, Varro R. R. 1 xxxi 5, Contr. to
Latin Lex. p. 4553 it is sometimes s elt
‘ferrag0,' and so Med. here.-H. Ι1)“1.]
1t is called ‘crassa’ from its effects‚ like
‘gfssffipc‘ilefflffixs’pifsessssiaig‘ed by ‘iam

preceding simile, though its elaboration domitis' in v. 206.
