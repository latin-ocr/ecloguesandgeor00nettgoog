497. [About 5ο B.c. Burebista organized
the Dacians into a formidable though
short-lived military state osa type common
amo savage tribes. About 46 he
raid the whole Balkan peninsula, and
Caesar planned a counter-campaign in
44. In 32 his successor Cotiso took
Antony's side, and Rome feared a Dacian
inroad: hence this line, Hor. Sat. 11 vi
53 (ae. 31) and Od. 11 vi 13, ‘paene
occupatam seditionibus Delevit urbem
Dacus et Aethiops.' The danger lasted
beyond Actium; even in 16 and 10 the
Dacians crossed the frozen Danube. See
Mommsen Mon. Ancyr. p. 30.]

‘ Coniurato Histro t ' Philarg. [and
Serv.] assert on authority os Aufidius
Modestus that the Dacians pledged them-
selves in Danube water not to return
home unless victorious: comp. Claudian
de Bell. Goth. 87. But the words may
well refer to the srozen Danube, thus in

earlier part of the verse from the charge
of selfish indiffaence, suggests that the
countryman does not pity poverty because
he is philosopher enough to understand
that it is not an evil but a blessing. Ger-
manus thinks Virg. means to represent the
countryman as free from the two emotions
which pervert the sense of justice, which

he proves from Aristotle to know no dis·
tinction of persons. The feeling again is
gulike tlgg general tone of the Georgics.

502. Rom. has ‘ insanumve.’

‘ Tabularia,’ [i.e. records of all public
business. Such records were kept in
temples, esp. in the temple os Saturn in
the Forum, and perhaps in the so-called
‘ Tabularium' above it on the Capitol
slope (Jordan, Topogr. der Stadt Rom. ι

that the poet speaks of the road to wealth
and honour through the favour of the
great, ‘ regum ' used as in Hor. Ep. 1 vii
37, xvii 43. The other interpretation,

· ‘ sack the palaces of kings,’ would create ἢ

a prosaic tautology with what follows.
