‘Genitoris' probably is merely a con·
stant epithet of a river (comp. the Greek
feeling for rivers as κουροτροφοι poem) as in A.
vm 72, ‘,tuque Ο Thybri, tuo genito:
cum flumine sancto) If we could sup ppose
Peneus to have been the father of Cyrene,
there would be more reason why Aristaeus
should go to the source of the river to
make her hear, just as Achilles 21125 to
Thetis, stretching his hands to the deep,
and is heard by her as she sits below by
the side of her old father (Il. 1 350, 358,
xv111 36, where, as here, the old god
takes no part in the action). But there
is no authority for such a parentage but
Hyginus Fab. 161, while Pind. (P. lx 13)
makes Cyrene the daughter of Hypseus.
We must suppose then that this chamber,
being the abode of the river· nym
figured by Virg. as accessible Ἣὲο
source of any river, and that Aristaeus
naturally betook himself to Peneus as the
river of Thessaly This will account also
for the supposed distance of the chamber—
