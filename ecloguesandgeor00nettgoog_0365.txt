branch is removed, that forms the point
of the precept.. ‘ Arbore,' the tree which
supggli‘ltgtglslffi ἔιιιῐῑιῧηςς for the ‘ seminarium ²
(se'e note on v. 267). Pliny xvn 105
refers to this assage, which he seems to
understand οἳ trees in general, while he
supposes Virg. to be speaking of cuttings
for grafting.

301. ‘ Tantus amor terrae: ’ so great
is their love for the earth that when they
are sar from it they are less vigorous.

‘Ferro retunso ι ’ comp. Col. ιν 24.

302. ⁸ Semina,’ the young vines or
trees; see v. 268.

⁶ Oleae ' Pal. Rom. Serv. Wagner con·
iectured ‘ olea ’ [which, according to Hoff-
mann, is the reading of Med.] and, eiving
‘ insere' the technical sense of grafting,
understood the cantion to be against graft-
ing the olive on the ‘ oleaster. This view
is apparently supported by Palladius (v 2),
who gives directions sor grafting olive on
oleaster without this bad result from a
fire. But this involves an extremely awk-
ward insertion of an isolated precept about
the olive in the midst of precepts about the
vine, which are continued down to v. 420,
where there is a distinct transition to the
olive 3 nor does Columella seem to be
aware of any danger to the olive from the
oleaster (v 9). lt seems better then to
retain ‘ oleae ’ and understand ‘insere ’ of
planting in the ‘ arbustum,’ as in Col. v 7,
‘ Arboribus rumpotinis si frumentum non
inseritur.' ‘Insere ’ thus = ‘ intersere,'
v, 299. It appears from Pliny xvn 200
that the olive, if not too leafy‚ was

as drawing too much nourishment from
the vine. There was an inducement to

¹ plant the ‘ oleaster ’ and ‘ corylus ' among

other trees, as affording foliage sor the
food os oettle, Col. v 9. Hence perhaps
the present cantion.

304. The tree is called πυκνὸν καὶ
λιπαρόν, Theophr. H. P. V 10, and is-
said to be good for burning.

‘SecutuS,' running along the wood.
Comp. A. vm 432, ‘ flammisque sequaci·
bus iraS.‘ The word, as Macleane re-
marks on Pers. Prol. 5, is used where,
strictly speaking, there is no notion os
following a lead; but the image seems
always to be that of following, whether or
no there is actually any thing to follow.

307. ‘Dominates victoriously among
the hranches and the summits that tower
so high.

Wakef. connects ‘ hoc’ with ν. 314,
taking ‘ ubi ‘ with ‘ valent ' and ‘ possunt‚’'
