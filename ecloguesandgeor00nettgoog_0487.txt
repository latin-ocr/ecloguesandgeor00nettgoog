Aristaeus stands, by the stream of Peneus.
356. ‘ Crudelem ' is a predicate, as in
E. v 23, where see note. Aristaeus’ cry

Heyne translates it, ough it may also
have a sense of ‘ unusual,' the sear in this

Od. x1 243, as
Macrob. (Sat. v 3) points out, Πορφυρεον

text, we must suppose that the waters first
separate on each side (ν. 359) 10 make a
dry way sor Aristaeus, and then, when he
has set his foot on the bottom, close over

361. The image is from

his head, and allow him to wall< under
them till he comes to the place where his
mother is. The mountainous aspect of
the water has reference then to its appear·
ance from the outside.

For ‘ faciem' Med. has ‘speciem’ [Pal.
has ‘ circumspicit,' a corruption probably
for ‘ circumstitit. ’-H. N.]

‘ Somnus: probably with the noise of
the water. A. 111 442, ‘ Averna sonantia

to which he thinks Virg. referS, of an
Egyptian custom of dedi ’ youths to
the nymphs: ‘qui quum a olevissent,

365. ‘ Motus aquarum ' would naturally
mean the heaving of water in a storin, as
in Prop. ιν (111) xv 31, ‘magnos cum
ponunt aequora motus! Here however
the sense seems to be ‘ the mighty flow
of waters ς ’ ‘ ingenti ’ refers to the number
of streams as much as to the size of any
particular stream.
