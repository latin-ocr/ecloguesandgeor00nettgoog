temptat sensuS,’ for ‘lues udi veneni.’ It
is a peculiarity-perhaps an affectation.
Spohn connects the ablative with ‘ diffusos,’
and so Forb. and Keightley. In any case
Virg. cannot be acquitted of obscurity, as
the ablative at first sight seems clearly
to belong to ‘vestim' which is scarcely
possible, though Trapp thinks that the
vine may be said to do what is really
done by the i ‚ to show how closel the

are united. he vine is intertwine wit

the ivy (both emblems of BacchuS, and
fit ornaments sor a drinking-cup), as in
Theocr. the ivy with the flowers os the
helichrysus.

‘ Hedera llens ’ is probably that kind
the leaves o which are marked with white,
or rather with light yellow 3 ‘ hedera alba,’
vu 28. [⁴ Pallante,' i.e. palante, Verona
l‘alimps.—H. N.]

[‘ Edera ' Verona PalimpS. originally.
The spelling was doubtful m the time of
Verrius Flaccus: Paul. p. 82. Miill. giving
⁸ ederam ' undere, p. 100, ⁶ hedera ' under
‘h‚' where three etymologies are offered,
‘quod haereat, sive quod edita petat, vel
quia id cui adhaeserit edat.’ Philarg-
here pronounces for ‘ edera.'—H. N. Rib-
beck now spells ‘ed·' exce t in G. lv 124]

40. ‘ In medi0,’ in the elds, the spaces
enclosed by the vine and ivy. Keightley.

‚Conon was an astronomer in the tune os

Ptolemy Philadelphus: the ‘ alter' was
probably Eudoxus, whose ‘ Phaenomena'
was versified by Aratus. [The Verona
scholia say that some commentators thought
of EudoxuS, some of AratuS, while others
were in favour os Archimedes, HipparchuS,
Euctemon, Hesiod, or Euclid.—H. N.]

‘ Totum orbem ’ apparently means the
whole circle of the heavens. Comp. A.

besides being characteristic of the acanthus
reminds us of the art of the workman, like
‘ mollis imitabitur aere capillos,' Hor. A.
P. 33. Contrast the detail os Menalcas
with the brevity of Damoeta8‚ who merely
mentions enough to show that his cups are
a sair match sor his rival’s, and then pro·
ceeds to depreciate them. .

47. here may be some mockery in the
repetition, as Voss suggestS, or Damoetas
may be carrying out his affected deprecia-
tion by not stopping to select words of his
own.

48. ‘ Compared with the heifer, the
cups deserve no praise.’ Most commen·
tators suppose the construction to be ‘ si
spectas (pocula) ad vitulam ε ' but though
