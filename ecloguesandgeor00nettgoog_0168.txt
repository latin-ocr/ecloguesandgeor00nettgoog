36. There seems no special relevancy
in the mention os the Trojan war. The
context does not suggest that the youthful
warrior is himself Achilles; nor on the
other hand can we suppose with Mr. Munro
that the great enemy of the Trojans re·

Virg. intended either of these thoughts,
he would have expressed himself more
definitely, as there is a prima facie incon-

ruity about each which it would have
{een the poet’s office to mitigate. Pro·
bably he merely instances the Trojan War
as a mythical war, without reflecting on
the legendary connexion between Troy
and Rome, which he was himself here·

38. ‘Vector,’ the passenger‚ which
seems to be its sense where it is used os
maritime carriage. ‘ Et ipse,’ the peaceful
passe-l nger, {End tiherefore much more the

39. ‘ Mutat merces ’ of a merchant,
Hor. S. 1 iv 29.

‘OmniS,' ete.: comp. G. 1 63, 11 109
notes. Virg. doubtless copies Hesiod‚
WorkS, 236 foll.. who says of his upright
nation, οὐδ’ ἐπὶ νηῶν Νέσσονται, καρπὸν

4ο. We seem to have gathered from
vv. 31 fou. that, even aster nature has
begun to return to the freedom and spon-
taneity of the golden age, man will still
continue to deal with her by force. We
are now told that in the full development
of her gracious bounty such violence will,

45

as it were, die a natural death, the same
change which releases the sea and the
seaman from traffic releasing the earth
and the husbandman from tillage.

41. Compare Lucr. v 933, vl 1253,
‘robustus curvi moderator aratri.' The

260s011., 355 foll. notes. ·

It signifies little whether ‘tauris’ be
taken as dat. or abl. Both are sufficiently
supported; and the differenee in sense
between the two cases in such a connexion
seems scarcely ascertainable.

43. [Serv. says ‘traditur in libris
Etruscorum, si hoc animal miro et in—
solito colore erit infectum, omnium rerum
felicitatem imperatori portendi.‘ The note
occurs ili-1I a fuller form in Macrob. S. 111

44. We ma]y either take ‘mutabit ' for
‘sucabit,' or in its common sense—⁶ will
change (the colour of) his fleece for (or
‘into ’) purple and yellow.'

‘ In pratis' is the same as ‘pa-secutis?

The country will enjoy the advantages

ta6nts, from which it rightly shrinks‚ G. 11

40, describes ‘sandyx’ as a mixture of
‘ sandaraca’ and ⁶ ochra,’ observing that
Virg. in this passage s aks os it as a
plant.—-H. N.] Some ave had the bad
taste to think that these lambs of the

olden age were to be turned soerlet by
§ceding on this plant. Bentley wished
to read ‘ nascentis‚’ which seems to
show ,that he did not understand ‘in
pratis·
