163. ‘Resuso‚’ blipffin back. ‘ Iulia
unda' = ‘unda 1u1i1 portus‚' which re·
sounds with the noise of the sea beating
against its outer barrier.

164. ‘ And the Tyrrhenian billows come
foaming up into the [stormy waters. —H.
N.] os Avernus) The sea is supposed to
enter through the channel mentioned on
v. 161, mix with the waters of the Lucrine,
and thence flow into Avernus, the more
inland lake. It is possible, too, that
‘fretis,' which is properly applied to the
Z²2h¹2²32¹33p¹ss223³2pg‘f'ffffiiffvailssrd ²³11?ssssss
case a contrast seems intended between
‘ Tyrrhenus' and ‘ Avernis,’ the effect of
the work being to mingle two distant
waterS.

165. Lucr. v 1255, ‘Manabat venis
serventibus in loca terrae Concava con·
veniens argenti rivus et auri.’ These
lines, however, refer to the actual lique·
saction of the metals by a conflagration.

‘ Rivos' and ‘ fluxit denote not streams
but streamlike threadS. ‘Auro plurima
fluxit ’ haS‚ however, been supposed to
mean the gold found in the Po, which is
mentioned by Pliny xxxm 66. [Traces
of the Cisalpine gold-workings still re·
main, Corpus Inscr. Lat. v p. 715] Pliny
also (xxxl 11 78) speaks of Italy as abound·

at the end of his Natural History (in the

says ‘Metallis auri, argenti, aeris, ferri,

that follows. ‘ Marsosz’ Appian, B. C.
1 46, Οὔτε κατὰ Μάρσων οὔτε ἄνευ Μάρσων
γενέσθαι θρίαμβον. ‘ Pubem Sabellam: ’
the name Sabellian was a general one,
including various tribes supposed to have
issued from the Sabines, MarsianS‚ and
Pelignians as well as Samnites and Lu-
canians.

168. ‘Malo,’ hardship. ‘Verutos2'
‘with rude spears3’ comp. A. vu 665,
‘ veruque Sabello.’ The weapon, pro·
perly called ‘verutum,' was a short dart
used by the light infantry os the Roman
army, and originally borrowed from the
Sabines,

169. These heroes saved Rome, the
Decii from the Latius, Marius from the
Cimbri, Camillus from the Gauls‘, the
Scipios from Carthage. So Octavian
saves her from enemioe in the East.

170. The form ‘Scipiades’ had been
already used by Lucilius, and Lucretius
calls Memmius ‘ Memmiades ¹ sor metrical
reasons· The combination of the Roman
family name with the Homeric patronymic
produces a hybrid effect, especially as there
is nothing in the family name itself to dis-
tinguish son from father. See Munro
Lucr. 1 26, 111 1034. As Virg. is using
the plural, we might expect him to have
talked of the ‘ gens Iulia ’ instead of indi-
vidualizing Octavian ς but the love os
variety and the desire to pay a higher
compliment doubtless led him to express
himself as he has done.

171, 172. [After Actium, Octavian spent
more than a year (3o·29) in restoring order
in Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor: ‘ex-
tremis oris’ and ‘Indum ’ are natural ex-
