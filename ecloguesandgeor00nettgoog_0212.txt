passage in Theocr. xxiv 91 fou„ where

Here the of the sacrificial boughs
and frankincense with the wax and clay,
the salt eake and sprigs of hay, answers
(as Voss suggests) to the burning of the
serpents3 and the ceremony of flinging
away the ashes is evidently meant to
be similar. There 15, however, some dif-
ference ιιι the detail. In Theocr. the ser·

vant is to ’the ashes across the stream
and thento them away ,and return
without looking ck3 in Virg. she 15 to

themklng away down the stream, not
looking back when doing so. Comp-

the passage ‘in Teocr might s est

by 3. sudden flame in the ashes. Serv.
makes Amaryllis the er, on account
ot' the words ‘ dum ferre moror,' [and so
Vahlen and Ribbeck in his last edition.]
But this would be awkward. We may
easily suppose that both enchantroes and
attendant would Join in removing the ashes.
The blazing os the fite was a good omen as
its smouldering was a bad one (comp. G. ιν
385, 386, Soph. Ant. 1006) 3 and asudden
blaze would naturally be thought an espe-
cial token of good. Serv. and Plutarch
(life of Cicer0, c. xx) relate that this omen
happened to Cicero' s wife as she was sacri·
ficing· to Vesta in the year of Catiline' s
conspiracy, and that it was interpreted as
