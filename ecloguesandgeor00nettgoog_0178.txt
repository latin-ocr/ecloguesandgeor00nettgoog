P. VERGILI MARONIS

sub pedibusque videt nubes et sidera Daphnis,
ergo alacris silvas et cetera rura voluptas
Panaque pastoresque tenet Dryadasque puellas,

nec lupus insidias pecori, nec retia cervis

60

ulla dolum meditantur; amat bonus otia Daphnis,
ipsi laetitia voces ad sidera iactant

intonsi montes; ipsae iam carmina rupeS,

ipsa sonant arbusta; dem, deus ille, Menalca!

sis bonus o felixque tuis! en quattuor aras:

65

ecce duas tibi, Daphni, duas altaria Phoebo.

58. All nature rejoices at his a theosi5‚
as all nature had mourned at is death.
The frisking of Pan and the Dryades
answers to the weeping of the nym hs
and the departure of Pales and Apo lo.
We must understand Menalcas as de·
seribing a state which is just beginning or
about to begin : but this will hardly excuse
the impropriety of re resenting two such
different soenes as th belonging to
{fiiffintoiiffi‘chfflss ‘ssffifi‘ssi’gmssffssngissiiss
minds of the two shepherdS.

‘Alacris’ denotes the frisking and
dancing of Pan and the mains, ‘frolic glee.’

‘ Cetera‚' because ‘rus' includes pas·
tures. [The word has not unnaturally
been criticised as feeble, but no good
emendation has been proposed.]

59. Virg. adopts the Greek form,
‘ Dryadas ς’ ⁶ Hyada5,' A. 1 7443 ‘ Phae·
tonnadas,’ E. vl 62. [Rom. ‘ Dryades.']

60. The features os the description are
taken from the golden age, as in E. ιν.
Comp. Theocr. xxxv 84.

61. ‘Otia' as in 1 6. ‘BonuS‚² of
deities, as in v 65, A. κη 647.

62. The mountains and woods resound
eries of joy, as before (v. 28) they re·
sounded groans of sorrovv. The words
are from Lucr. 11 327 foll.‚ ‘ clamoreque
montes Icti reiectant voces ad sidera
mundi! Virg. means to attribute the joy to
the mountains themselveS, as in x 15 they
3303112513534'5‘2122023235:333&ssae
‘ Even the traveller on the mountain, even
the vine-dresser under the rock (ι 56),
shouts and sings for joy in my ears.'

63, ‘ Intonsi,' with all their forests.
(Serv. ‘inmedui.') ‘Intonsaque caelo
Attollunt mpita,’ A. lx 681, of oakS.
The primary notion here is that the wild-

ness of the mountains makes the demon·
stration more marked. But it is possible
that we may be meant to conceive of
them as exulting in their shaggy strength
now that a state of nature is restored, as
in Isainh xw 7, 8, ‘ The whole earth is at
rest and is quiet, they break forth into
{³11¹ ³31³. 2335& ἶὲἑῗῃῗηέζῗςῗῒ ἐῗὲἒέ
thou art laid down, no fellet ιζ] εἷ’ωε up
against us.'

64. ⁴ Sonant carmina ι’ comp. Hor.
od. 11 xiii 26, ‘ Et te sonantem plenius
auree, Alcaee, plectro dura navis, Dura
fugae mala, dura belli.'

‘ Deus, deus ille, Menalca,’ is what the
rocks and woods utter. ‘ We have a new
god, a new god, Menalcas! Forb. comp.
Lucr. v 8, ‘deus ille fuit, deus, inclute
Memmi.’

65. ‘ Sis felix,’ A 1 330.

66. [‘ Ecce ' with acc„ common in early
Latin, occurs here only in Augustan Latin t
Wblffiin’s Archiv v 24]

‘Altariaz' [Serv. mentions that some
took ‘altaria ’ to mean ‘offerings :’ a
sense which it certainly seems to bear in
Lucan 111 404, ‘structae diris altaribus
arae.’ Comp. Virg. E. vm 105, A. v
93, ΧΠ 174. See Contributions to Latin
Lexicography, p. 140. ‘ Four altarS, as
offerings, two to thee, two to Phoebus!
-H. N.] Or it may be that Daphnis,
as a here, has only libations offered to
him, not victims.

‘ Duas altaria Phoebo: ’ Apollo is asso·
ciated with Daphnis as the god both of
herdsmen (above, ν. 35) and ts. He is
as naturally associated with esar, whose
birthday fell on the Ludi Apollinares (3 Id.
Iul.), but as the Sibylline books forbade
the rites of any other god to be celebrated
at the same time with those of Apelle,
