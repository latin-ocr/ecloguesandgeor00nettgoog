EXCURSUS ΟΝ THE RELATION OF THE FIRST TO THE NINTH
ECLOGUE.

[Τιιιι first Eclogue represents Virgil as restored to the possession of his estate, while
the ninth complains of his violent expulsion from it. This fact was explained by
Servius, and is still explained, 1 think, by modern critioe‚ by the hypothesis that after
the poet had been restored by Octavian he was again expelled, and afterwardS, at
some time not specified, again reinstated.

But it may be doubted whether this notion of a double ejection rests on sufficient
evidence. The two poenis in question lend no real support to it, but, is anything,
rather the reverse. The ninth Eclogue represents Virgil as saying that a misfortune
had come upon him of which he had never had any apprehension, ‘quod numquam
veriti sumus3' strange language, surely, had he been ejected only a few months
before. The poem proceeds= ‘ 1 had heard that Menalcas' poetry bad proved the
salvation os his estate,' * omnia carminibus vestrum servasse Menalcan! ‘ Yes,
and it was a mere rumour, for the din os arms has silenced poetry.' These words do
not necessarily, I think, imply niore than that Virgil had hoped at one time to retain
his farm, but that it had after all been taken away. It is indeed quite likely that
when the first order came for the confiscation os the Mantuan territory, Virgil made
interest with Pollio for at least the temporary preservation of it, and that thus arose the
rumour alluded to. But if Virgil had really gone to Rome before the ninth Eclogue
was written, and returned with an order from Octavian sor the restoration of his
estate, is 'it conceivable that he should have made no mention in the poem of so
important a fact? But what does he say of Octavian Ρ Only this :

⁸ ecce Dionaei processit Caesaris astrum,
astrum, quo segetes gauderent frugibus,'

* the star of Caesar has arisen, under which the fields ought to be rq‘oicing in their
fruits'; for 1 do not know what other meaning the words can bear. It is his com-
plaint in the fifth Eclogue and in the first Georgic that the overthrow os Julius Caesar’s
authority has ruined agriculture, and in the same spirit he expresses a faint hope (and
no more) in the ninth Eclogue that the star of Caesar may again bless the country.
The life of Virgil by Suetonius makes no mention os a double ejection.¹ And the
commentar-y attributed to Probus, which‚(in this part os it) seems to be based on the
