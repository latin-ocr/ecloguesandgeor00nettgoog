‘ Ad limum‚’ down to the mud at the
bottom, constructed apparently with
‘ tepefacta coquebant) which seems =
‘tepefaciebant et coquebant?

429. ‘ E fluctibus,’ from its position,
seems to go with ‘ petens’ rather than
withbi ibat,' though either construction is
tena c.

vasti‚' an obviously inferior order.

’Ὀξετροτςιεω’“ῑι’3(ἰ.1εᾱ. and Rom.) seems
better than ‘ dispersit,' on account of
‘ibat ' preceding, which would have led
us to expect ‘spargebat,’ if the past had
been retained, since there can hardly have
been any intention to mark a dist-‘erence‘ of
‘³¹¹3‘Ambyamffleffi‘22‘3ie ,ξῗέ ῗῗιεξεῖῗέῗέῗιξξ

Menelaus dwells so feelingly.

432. ⁸ Stratus somno ’ occurs twice in

mean ‘ at one time or other,’ as in 421, etc.

[‘Stabulis’ Pam—H. N.]

434. ‘Vitulos' is perhaps introduced
on ⁹:⁶9⁰,um os the comparison with ‘ vituli
manni.

⁸ Ad tecta reducit’ like ‘redeunt in
tecta' of the goats, 111 316. Pal. has

perhaps imitating this passage.

‘ Mnacula rerum,' probably = ⁶ miras

culosas‚' A. 1 204. But a comparison of
this expression with those referred to on
G. 11 534 may strengthen the hint given
there, that ⁸ rerum ’ may have a local sense,
‘ in the world!
