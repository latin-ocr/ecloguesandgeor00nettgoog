probably is (as Serv. says) ‘undique bellum
movetur.’ Vv. 510·511 might refer to
Antony‚ who to arm against Oc·
tavian in 32, but the language is vague.
Is the lines were meant to refer to definite
events of about 32, we should have ex-
pected]Dacia <11 497) rather than Ger·
mama.

51ο. ‘ Vicinae urbes : ’ [Dio L 6 clearly
implies that some Italian citieS, esp. those
in which veterans of Antony were settled,

ve trouble to Octavian ε such a city was

ononia.—-H. N. The words, however,
need be no more than the antithesis of the
preceding line.] ‘ Ruptis inter se legibu5‚'
breaking the laws which bound them to·
gether. ‘ Legibus‚’ the laws of civil
society. Forb. comp. A. vm 540, ‘ Pos-
cant acies et foedera rumpant.‘

511. ‘ Impius' is emphatic ; most of
the wars of the time were connected
directly or indirectly with the civil con·
flict.

512. ‘carceribus ι ’ the ‘carceres’were
stalls at the end of the circuS, with gates
of open woodwork, which were opened si—
multaneously to allow the chariots to start.

Med. late corr. and most M S. of
Serv. ‘addunt in spatia,’ and so Rib-
beck, Con' on, and most edd. since
Burmann, wo explain it as = ‘addunt
(se) in spatia,' throw themselves on the
course, or ‘ addunt (gradum) ' or ‘ addunt
(spatia) in spatia) The ellipse, which
must be assumed with either reading
(6 spatio ’ or ‘ spatia'), seems unpasalleled.]

but this hardly agrees with v. 500.
