124. ‘ Pallentisque hederas,’ E. 111
39 note. ‘ Amantis litora myrtos,' 11
112.

125. ‘ Oebaliae‚’ a name of Laconia, is
given here, as in Claud. Prob. et Ol.
Cons. 260, to Tarentum, which was
founded by S rtanS.

[‘Arcis ι ’ aL, Probus, Arusianus (vn
491, Keil), Philarg., the Berne scholia,
and so Ribbeck, Thilo, Nettleship, etc.
‘Altis‚' Med. corn, Vat., Serv. ς Claudian
Panegyr. 260, uses ‘ Oebalia' as a noun.
Med. had originally ‘ autis.’ Con. pre·
ferred ‘altis' as having the most MS.
support, but the evidence is really rather
in favour of ‘ arcis,’ which (as Con. says)
is the more Virgilian]

126. ‘Nigerz ‘Thecourse otthe Galae-
sus is short, but it is of some depth, and
its waters are clear: hence V‘ . calls it
‘⁸ dark,'’ in opposition probab y to the
“ flavus ’' Tibns, and other rivers of Italy
which were usually turbid ’ (Keightley).
A contrast is of course intended between
‘niger’ and ‘ flaventia) ν(

129. ‘Commoda‚’ if not ‘opportuna,’
may be transferred from human qualitiaess
see 11 223, ‘ facilem pecori et patientem

for sowing, being applied improperly to
‘ pecori,’ as ture-land. Ribbeck how·

the sake of the bees (Heyne)‚ and also for
medicinal purposes (Martyn).
