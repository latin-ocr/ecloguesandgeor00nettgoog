P. VERGILI MARONIS

infelix sua tecta supervolitaverit alis?

omnia quae, Phoebo quondam meditante, beatus
audiit Eurotas iussitque ediscere lauroS,

ille canit3 pulsae referunt ad sidera valles ;

cogere donec ovis stabulis numerumque referre 85
iussit et invito processit Vesper Olympo.

low. In this case Virg. followed the Greek
version of the story (as Heyne thinks), in
spite of the other passages referred to on
v. 783· b'ut this would not suit ‘deserta
ξὶξὲζίξῗὲἑε ‘ &etit fffegssiffifffissesssscffl
subit,’ tho h he does not explain which
is which. ere the ambiguity is certainly
awkward, and looks like a confusion of
the habits of the nightingale and swallovv.
⁴ Quibus alis petiverit’ is for ‘quomodo
alis petiverit,' like ‘quo fonte’ v. 43.

8ι. This line recurs in the Ciris, v. 51,
with ‘caeruleis' for ‘infelix.' [‘Supra
volitaverit ’ Rom—H. Ν.]

82. ‘ Meditante,’ 1 1. ‘ Beatus‚' happy
in hearing such a song.

83. ‘Eurotas' points to Apollo’s love
for the Spartan youth Hyacinthus, to
whom we must suppose him to have
sun .

ere and elsewhere the MSS. are
divided between ‘laurus ’ (Med.) and
‘lauros ' (most MSS. ). Virg. used ‘laurus’
and ‘lauri’ indifferently in the nom. pl.
(comp. 11 54, A. 111 91), and his usage

need not have been more uniform in the
acc.: but in such caseS, where early
authorities differ, a modern critic has
small means of deciding. Comp. vu 6;
vm 13.

84. Comp. v 62, and Lucr. 11 327.

85. An incidental proof that Chromis
and Mnasyllos were shepherdS, as no
others are represented as listeners.

[‘Referre Med. and Pal. originally,
Rom.‚ Serv„ and Nonius, p. 381 ς ‘ referri '
Mssd. and Pal. corr„ and so Ribbeck and
Τ 'lo.

86. J‘ Invito,’ as Olympus was himself
list ‘ . Voss comp. 11. xvm 239,
where fieta bids the sun set against his will.

‘Olympus' is rather the heaven than
the mountain, over which the evening
star is said to rise, as in vm 30, ‘gtgbi
11 1,
‘ Iamque iugis summae surgebat Lucifer
Idae.' In either case it is probably to be
constructed with ‘processit.’ αὔλιος, the

tar of the shee folds was a Greek epithet
οἳ the evemng star.

Rom. is deficient from here to x 10.
