produces fruit enough3 and on the unjust nation, which is ever
wasted by famine and pestilence‚ ever cursed with barrenness in
its homes, ever feeling the hand of Zeus in the loss of its broad
armieS, of its waHS, or of its ships at sea. The latter are told
that there are thirty thousand heavenly watchers over the affairs
of men, who walk abroad over the earth, clad in mist, to see the
right and wrong that are done, and that Justice when outraged
by human crime sits down by her father ZeuS, and talks to him
of the perverse heart os man, that a people may suffer for the
unrighteousness of its kings. And now he quits justice, and
dilates with equal emphasis and at still greater length on the
second part of his thesiS‚ the duty of work. The two are indeed
closely connected, as the opposition is between living on others
and living by a man's own exertion. The easy path of vice is
contrasted‚ in lines that have become famouS, with the up-hill
path os virtue, steep and rugged at first, but smooth when the
ascent has once been mastered. ‘ Work then, Perses} he con·
tinueS, ‘ like a man of gentle blood as thou art, that famine may
hate thee as its foe, and august Demeter of the bright crown
may love thee and fill thy granary with sustenance.’ One
terse proverbial saying follows another, to illustrate the broad
distinction between the working and the unworking lise: ‘ Shame
is found with poverty, boldness with wealth t gain from the hand
os rapine is not good, gain from heaven’s hand is far better:’
while other maxims of virtue and prudence are intermixed,
against violations of social and family tieS, on neighbourS‚ on
gists, on spending and saving, on women and children, ending
with the assurance that if Perses' heart is set on wealth, he must
work, work upon work. From this point the precepts assume a
more definite and business-like character in reference to agri-
cultural life. The rising os the Pleiades is the signal for reaping,
their setting for ploughing. A man should strip to sow, strip to
plough, strip to reap, is he would have every thing come up in its
season, and not go begging to his neighbourS. ‘ It was thus that
thou camest to me even now: but 1 will give thee nought;
work, foolish PerseS, work the work that the gods have assigned
to men, that thou mayest not have to ask from others in vain :
twice or thrice thou mayest obtain: but if thou troublest them
