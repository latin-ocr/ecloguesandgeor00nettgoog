os observing. ‘ His virtuous household
keeps the traditions of purity.'

days would mark at once the leisure and
the simplicity of country life. Most festi·
vals in the old calendar were rural.

528. ‘Ignis ubi in medio' must be a
turs-built altar, not the ‘focus’ in the
house, on account os ‘ susus per herbam: ’
Tibull. 11 i 21 and Hor. Epod. 11 65 are
not strictly parallel. The description is
quite general. For ‘in medio’ Med. a
m. pr. has ‘ingeni0,’ whence Burm. con·
jectured ‘geni0.’

⁶ Cratera coronant‚' a mistranslation or
alteration of Homer’s κρητῆρας ivi-eori-
ψαντο mir-oto (Iliad 1 470, etc.)‚ which
means ‘ filled the bowls with wine,'whereas

Virg . means ‘ wreath the bowl with flowerS, ' .

as appears srom A. 111 52 5, ‘ magnum cra-
tera corona Induit implevitque mero.'

‘ Palaestrae,' so Med. etc.‚ [dat. of pur·

532. ‘ Vitam coluere : ' Lucr. has ‘co-
lere aevum‚' v 1145, 1150. The Sabines
are a type of hardy simplicity: comp.
Hor. Epod. 11 41. Od. 111 vi 39, A. ix
603, etc. So Livy 1 xviii 4 talks of
‘disciplina tetrica ac tristi veterum
Sabinorum.’ The order in Pal. is ‘ vitam
veteres.’

533. The mention of ‘Etruria’ has
been thought to be a compliment to
Maecenas. It is quite as likely to be
an instance of Virg.’s feeling for an-

q534): ‘ Scilicet ε ’ comp. 1 282 note.
Here, as in that passage, ‘scilicet’ is
inserted rhetorically, to give importance
to the words connected with it. Some edd.
place the sto aster ‘crevit‚’ taking ‘sci-
icet' with w at follows. But comp. the
position os ‘scilicet’ in the passage just
referred to.

‘ Rerum pulcherrima:' such expres·
sions as ‘ nemorum maxima ’ above v. 15,
Hor. S. 1 ix 4 ‘dulcissime rerum‚’ and
Ov. M. vm 49 ‘pulcherrime rerum‚’
make us doubt whether the genitive here ⁸
is a real partitive, and whether the agree-
ment in gender os ‘pulcherrima' with
‘ rerum ' is not merely accidental. Comp.

here, and still more where it recurs in A.
vt 783. For the importance which the
Romans attached to the number os the
hius, which they retained when by the
expansion of the city the hills themselves
were changed, see Niebuhr i 382 (Eng.
