P. VERGILI MARONIS

aesculus in primis, quae, quantum vertice ad auras 'U ·'
aetheriaS, tantum radice in Tartara tendit.

ergo non hiemes illam, non flabra neque imbres
convellunt; immota manet, multosque nepoteS,

multa virum volvens durando saecula vincit ;

tum fortis late ramos et bracchia tendens
huc illue, media ipsa ingentem sustinet umbram.
Neve tibi ad solem vergant vineta cadentem;
neve inter vites corylum sere; neve flagella
summa pete, aut summa defringe ex arbore plantas; 257

291. ‘Aesculusz’ Pliny xvn 201 says
‘ Transpadana Italia . . . quercu arbustat
agros‚' i.e. plants them in ‘arbusta’ to
support the vine. Part of the following
description, which appears sim ly orna·
mental, is repeated by virg. of t e ‘ quer-
cus ’ A. ιν 445 soll.

294. ‘ Multos nepotes,’ many successive
generations, Comp. v. 58. The Verona
fragm„ Gud., and other MSS„ and N onius
p. 525, read ‘multosque per 2111105,’211 in·
terpolation‚ as Wagn. conjectures, derived
from lv 208.

Corn . ‘tot volvere casuS,' A. 1 9; a

el use of ‘ condere ’ has been noticed

. lx 52. The notion implied in ‘vol-
vens' would be more naturally coupled
with ‘ saecula,’ as in ‘ volvenda dies, A.
ix 6, but such inversions are not rare.
‘ Many are the posterities, many the gene-
rations of men that it rolls along, and
lives down victoriously‚ while stretching
out its sinewy branching arms on all sides,
it su ports with its central bulk the vast
weight of their shade.’

296. ‘ Tum ' appears to indicate a
point in a description, not necessarily a
point of time, and generally the last int,
so as to be nearly = ‘denique’ omp.

It seems hardly necessary with Heyne to
divide the poetical picture logically, and
say, that the depth of the roots is the
cause, first, of the firmness (v. 293) and
long life (vv. 294, 295) of the tree3
seoondly‚ of its power to bear the weight

of its boughs (vv. 296, 297). Ribbeck
adopts ‘ pandens’ [a variant mentioned in
the Berne scholia,] from Gud.

298. ‘ A vineyard should not face west t
a hazel should not be planted to support
the vine: cuttings should not be taken
from the top, either of the vine or of its
supportet: a blunt knife should not be
applied to the young plant 2 2 wild olive

scription-

The precept ‘Neve tibi ad solem’ is
noticed by Col. (111 12), and Pliny (xvii
19), with an intimation that it was not

the aspect of a vineyard should vary with
the climate.

299. Pliny (xvu 240) says of the vine
‘ odit et corylum.'

‘ Flagellum: ' the tendet shoot at the
end of the branchoe of the vine. Varro 1
xxxi 3, ‘ Quam vocant minorem flagellum,

mam! Catuli. Lxu 52, ‘ vitis . . .
Iamiam contingit summum radice flagel-
lum! ‘ Summa flagella’ doae not mean
the end of the shoot, but the shoot at the
top of the vine. For the precept that
cuttings are not to be made from the top-
most shoots‚ comp. Col. 111 10. Pliny
xvn 105 recommends the contrary.

300. ‘Defringe’ is used by Varro (1
xl 4), who opposes it to ‘deplantare,’
the latter being the less violent mode of
separation. The word here is not ·to be
pressed ; it isnot the manner of removing

the brmch, but the part from which the
