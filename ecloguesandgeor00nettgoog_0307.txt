‘Agitator aselli, the driver, like‘ equo

to drive the ass to market. We need
hardly inquire whether ‘aselli’ belongs

(Works 765 oll. ) had treated the subject
at much greater length. Varro, 1 37, has
a chapter οιι the same subject, but his
treatment is entirel different. Virgss s
own treatment is sufficiently cursory, only
three days being named' ιιι 211, for good or
for evil, and those not accurately repre·
