et graviter frendens sic satis ora resolvit:

‘ Non te nullius exercent numinis irae.
magna luis commissa: tibi has miserabilis Orpheus

suscitat, et rapta graviter pro coniuge saevit.

by the position of ‘denique,’ ‘ vi denique
multa' seeming as if it might have the
force of ‘ vix tandem.' The former is more
in keeping with the picture given in the
next two lines. Homer says only ὡς
ἐφάμην· ὁ δέ μ’ αὐτίκ’ ἀμειβόμενος προσέ·
ειπεν, Od. lv 471.

451. ‘Lumine glauco ’ either with
‘ ardentis' or with ‘oculos.’ The colour
of the eye is doubtless attributed to Pro·
teus as a sea-god (v. 388) ; but it is worth
while remarking with Cerda that the
epithet in Hom. seems to go along with
fierceness (the ‘ truces et caerulei oculi ’ of
Tac. Germ. 4), so that the mood of Proteus

is issarilvss‘fess‘sspffiffffissff ‘gf‘ssisffiffll
sure at the violence put on him, depends
on the interpretation we give to ‘ multa
vi)

‘ Fatis' may be either a dative or a
modal abl„ but is more robably dative,
though ov. Μ. xm 12 , · expectatoque
resolvit Ora sono,' which Cerda quotes»,
favours the abl. Comp. A. 11 246, where
there is the same question, the balance in·
clining towards the dative.

⁶ Fatis ’ here may well mean orales, as
Α. 1 382, ‘data sata secutuS,’ etc.

453·463. stoicus .· ‘ The cause of your
trouble is the vengeance of Orpheus. His
wife in t ' to escape from you was
bitten to ἓξὲξ] by a serpent. The nymphs
watlgil for her, and her husband was incon·
sola e.'

453. An emphatic assurance that the
affliction is a divine visitation. So in
Greek, οὐκ ἄνευ θεῶν (Eur. Iph. A. 809),
οὐκ ἀμήνιτον θεοῖς (Aesch. Ag. 649).
Taubm. comp. A. xl 725, ‘At non haec
nullis hominum sator at ue deorum Ob·
servans oculis.' The eity spoken of
must be the nymphs, as appears from vv.
532 1011.. not Tisiphone, as Serv. and

others suppose

wagn„ who‘wm not auow the 1engthen·

ing of a short syllable where there is no

pause in the sense, thinks the early part of
the line is corrupt.

454 ‘ The crime you are ex iating is
great! For ⁸ luis ’ Rom. and ot ers have
‘ lues,’ which Philarg., [the Beme scholia]
and Cerda curiously interpreted as a sub-
stantive. ⁸ Magna lues: id est, magnum
scelus.’ Serv. mentions a question about
the punctuation, whether ‘ nbi ' should be
connected with what precedes or with what
follows.

455. [⁸ Ad meritum ' Pal. and so Reiske,
Heyne, Ribbeck, H. N. This suits the

‘ ffiuenas: Heyne suggests, may be the

summoned, explains ‘ ni Fata resistant,
which is a sort of pr ant expression, the
meaning being that rpheus will summon
ruore, or that his summons will be heard,
unless the Fates interpose. The Fates
are perhaps those of AristaeuS, though the
word may be understood generally.

For ‘ni ’ Med. has ‘nisi.'

‘ Rapta,' snatched from him by death,
as v. 504 shows. In Ovid’s account
(M. xl 63 soll.) Orpheus and Eury·
dice are reunited aster death. From
Virg.'s language here we might almost
infer that he did not mean this to be the
case, though his words must not be
pressed.
