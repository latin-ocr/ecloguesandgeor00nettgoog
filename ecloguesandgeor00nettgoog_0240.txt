132 oN THE LATER

N emesianus,² who, if not Calpurnius, was certainly an imitator of
Calpurnius, makes his first Eclogue a funeral poem on MeliboeuS, an
exalted personage resemng the Meliboeus of his prototype. Tityrus
is asked by Timetas to sing, but excuses himself on account of his age,
and begs that the author of the request, who has become recently dis·
tinguished by a victory over MopsuS, will himself perform the task,
taking as his subject the death of their common friend. Timetas com-
plies, having recently composed an epicedium which he has inscribed
on the bark of a neighbouring cherry· ·.tree Air, earth, and water are
invoked to carry the lament to the ears of Meliboeus, whom the poet
then proceeds to panegyrize.

‘Longa tibi cunctisque diu spectata senectus,
felicesque anni, nostrique novissimus aevi
circulus, innocuae clauserunt tempora vitae.
nec minus hinc nobis gemitus lacrimaeque fuere,
quam si florentis mors invida pelleret annos.
nec tenuit talis communis causa querellas :
heu, Meliboee, iaces letali frigore segnis
lege hominum, caelo dignus, canente senecta,
concilioque Deum. plenum tibi ponderis aequi
pectus erat: tu ruricolum discernere lites
adsueras, varias patiens mulcendo querellas.
sub te ruris amor, sub te reverentia iusti
floruit, ambiguos signavit terminus agros.
blanda tibi vultus gravitas, et mite serena
fronte supercilium, sed pectus mitius ore!

The usual topics then succeed ε the gods of the country bring gists
in honour of the dead: trees and herdS‚ ‘ nostra πωπω( repeat his
name: for the sea and land will change their inhabitantS, and the pro-
ducts of the seasons become confused, before Timetas will oense to sing
of him. Tityrus compliments the singer, hints that the song may be the
means of advancing him from a country life to a life· m Rome, a species
of promotion which these shepherds appear especially to desire, and
finally reminds him that the hour ts late. Eptphunus (ivl-funus) is the
title which the MSS. give to the poem—a curiously illiterate confusion
of Greek and Latin.
