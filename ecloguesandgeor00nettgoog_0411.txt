et Iovis in luco currus agitare volantis:

primus equi labor est, animos atque arma videre
bellantum lituosque pati tractuque gementem

serre rotam et stabulo frenos audire sonantis;

tum magis atque magis blandis gaudere magistri 185

atque haec iam primo depulsus ab ubere matris

life. When their third year is past they

they should be fed well: before, they are
apt to be restifl'.’ '

179. ‘ Studium ad bella: go together.
This seems the only natural construction,
and is supported by the context, ‘prae-
labi' and ‘ agitare' both referring to the
breeder’s aim sor himself. Virg„ as
Wund. remarks», doubtless thought of
such phrases as ‘ studium conferre ad
aliquid.² ‘ Studere in aliquid' is also
found. Heyne understood ‘ formare ’ from
v, 163, but Wund. justly complains of the
unauthorized ellipse. ·

180. Virg., writing from the ins iration-

οἱ his Greek models, talks of the lympic
chariot taces rather than of those of the
circus. ,

181. ‘ Iovis in luce,’ the Altis, where
the tace-course was. Πρόκειται δ’ ἄλσος
ἀγριελαίων ἐν ᾦ τὸ στάδιον, Strabo vu
353. Vat. has ‘volentis.'

182. ‘ Primus equi labor,’ the first part
of a horse's training.

183. ‘Gementem' is emphati03 it is
the noise of the wheels that a sod is to be
taught to bear.

184. Varro 11 vii 12, ‘eademqne causa
ibi frenos suspendendum, nt eculi con·
suescant et videre eorum faciem et e
motu audire crepitus' The sound is
not merely the jingling of bridles, but of
phells which were frequently attached to

em.

185. ‘ Tum ’ seems to come under ‘pri-
mus labor,' not to be distinguished from it.

‘Blandis,' caressing, as v. 496, E. lv

²³² Magistri’ might refer speciauy to the

trainer (comp. Hor. Ep. 1 ii 64) as distinct
from the breeder, v· 1183 but there is
hardly evidence that Virg. meant to dis-
criminate them.

186. ‘ Manibusque lacessunt Pectora
plausa cavi5,’ A. κη 85, Gr. ποππὺζειν.

187. Philarg.‚ followed by Wakef.‚
makes ‘primo' adverbial, but it is evi-
dently an e ithet of ⁸ ubere,' though the
sense inten ed is that of ‘ primum.’

188. ‘Audeatz ’ Med. originally, Pal„
fragm. Vat. ‘ Audiat’ (Med. corr„ Rom.)
was the vulgate before Heinsius. Ladewig
needlessly conj. ‘gaudeat.’ The sense is
that natural timidity should be overcome
and contage developed.

‘ Inque vicem z ’ these experiments on
his eourage are to alternate with weari
3²oe halter(Wagn.). So Trapp, ‘ now an

en.

‘ Capistra ' were made of osiers,[whence
‘mollibus'

189. ‘Etiam’ = ‘adhuess A. Vl 4853

thaps A. 11 291 [and often in Latin be-

ore virgin. Heius. read ‘ et iam,’ from
a mistake in ChariS. p· 239, where the
line is quoted. Med. has ‘iam iamque'
as a late correction for ‘ etiamque,' and
sss& [susas «ετ „222220223
‘ et iam.'

‘Inscids aevi' might be taken as =
‘inscii aevi ' (which seems to be Martyn’s
view, ‘of tender years '), like ‘integer
aevi' A. 11 638, lx 255, ‘aevi maturus’
v 73. But ‘ venturi inscius aevi,' A. v111
627, is in favour of making ‘aevi' the
objective gen. A question still remains
whether the sense is ‘unconscious of his
powers' (Heyne), or ‘⁹ orant of life,’
which would agree effi& y well with the

context. Virg. may ve contemplated
both sense&
