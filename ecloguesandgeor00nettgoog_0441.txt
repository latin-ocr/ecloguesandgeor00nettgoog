513. Nicand. Ther. 186, ἐχθρῦν που
τέρα κεῖνα καρήασιν ἑμπελάσειε. The very
mention of such horrors calls forth a de·

recation, ‘ ominis causa,’ as in A. 11 484.
g'he feeling seems to be that, as such
things are and must be, the gods should
avert them from the speaker, who believes
himself to be well deserving, and turn them
on those whom he hates. The enemies
here are probably those of Rome, not the
poet’s own, though such expressions of
personal malignity, in jest or in earnest,
are common elsewhere, e. g. Hor. Od. 111
xxvii 21. With the first part of the line
oePgrrsseirlll' ²313hness, as in E. v111 41.
Rom. has ‘ ardorem.'

514. ‘Nudis,’ from the ulceration of
the gums (Martyn)‚ or simply from the
opening os the mouth (‘ Mollia ricta fre-
munt duros nudantia dentes,’ Lucr. v
1064, quoted by Heyne), or because of the
looseness of their jaws (⁸dentes crepuere
retecti,’ Pers, 111 101). This last would

ee with ‘ morte sub aegra,’ as explained
a ve, their seebleness making their mad-
ness more de lorable. In any case we may
agree with hilarg.‚ ‘ut foeditatem ex·
primeret, adiecit: nudiS.'

515-536. ‘Oxen felliu the actos plough·
ing, bloody soam gushing from their
mouths3 the ploughman had to separate
the dead from the living, and sus nd his
labour. Past caring sor shade, erbage,
or water, they sank unnerved, with closed
εγω and drooping neck, despite of all their
services, and of the natural and healthsul
simplicity of their life. Oxen could not
be got to draw the car to Juno’s temple,
so ‘men had to take buffaloes‚ without

with their nails, and drew the wains them-
selves)

515. Imitated by Ov. M. vn 538, 39.
Comp. Plaut. Trin. 11 iv 122 (cit on
G. 11 403). ‘ Ecce autem ’ calls attention
to a new object, something like καὶ μὴν in
Greek. See A 11 318, 526, etc.

‘Fumans’ 11 542. He falls in the
middle of his exertion (com . ‘ duro ’).
‘ Sub vomere ’ as he has to p l under the
weight of the thing he dragS.

51⁶· A'third imitation of Lucr. 111 489,
already glanoed at vv. 84, 283.

⁵¹7· ‘ Ciet gemitus,’ like ‘ ciebat fletus,'
A. 111 344. [‘ Et'for ‘ it’ Med and Pal.
⁸ Tristes,’ ‘gloomily.‘—H. Ν.] .

518. ‘ AbiungenS,’ unyoking, [occurs
here only in this sense; lt is apparently
an experimental variation on the ordinary
‘disiungere.’ Scaliger introduced it by
conj. in Prop. 11 xviii 10. See Wtslfflin s
Archiv iv 305.] The present part. is sor
the past, ιν 513, A. 1 305.

⁸ F raterna morte ’ is probably to be con·
structed with ‘abiungens,' as a poetical
equivalent for ⁴ fratre mortuo = ’ but it
need only mean at or in consequence of
his brother’s death, like A. lv 502.

519. [Ρ21., Donatus on Terence And.
11 v 1, and Serv. on E. 11 70 have ‘ reli-
quit,' and so Heyne. The notes of Serv.
and Donatus ap rently come from the
same source-411.>a N.]

520. An imitation, as Macrob. Sat. vl
5 has seen, of Lucr. 11 361 soll. (see E.
vm 85 soih), ‘Nec tenerae salices, atque
herbae rore vigentes Fluminaque illa
queunt summis labentia ripis Oblectare
animum subitam ue avertere curam. ’ Virg.
resers to the ox w ich has just fallen dying.

522. 111 deviating from Lucr. l. c. Virg.
has perhaps thought of what would charm
