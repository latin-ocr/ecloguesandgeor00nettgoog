THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lxv

(1) 8001< 111. DE mmscnss‘rxs censuimus,

Priscian, in the passage already quoted, gives a list which he took,
as he sayS, from the treatises of Caper and Probus de dubiis generibus
This list is partly alphabetical, ‘Vetustissimi in multiS, ut diximus,
supra dictarum terminationum inveniuntur confudisse genera, nulla signi·
fimtionis differentia coacti, sed sola auctoritate, ut laic et haec asperge,
alvus, arcus, adeps vel adipes, charta, carde, cims vel ciner, cervix, collis,
crux, calx, cupressus, platanus, populus, laurus, aquila, crinis, carbasus,
colus, lu'c et haec cassis, clunis, hic et haec conscia (P), callis, fornax, frutex,
grex, frons frontis, hic et haec humus, imbrex, latex. Accius ‘ non calida
latice lautus :' lembus, linter, lepus, agnus, leo, pampinus, perdix, laic et
ltaec palumbes, hic et haec faex, rudens ὁ πρότονος, socrus, supparus
περιῶμιον et hoc supparum, senex, stirps, torris ὁ δειλός, tiaras, Tibris,-
amnis, torques, trames, asper, ln· et leae vepres. ' This list is alphabetical,
with three exceptions. After cupressus come platanus, populus, laurus,
aquila.- after lepus, agnus, and after Ttbris, amms: a fact to which 1'
shall recur in a moment.

This list only includes instances of confusion between the masculine
and feminine genderS. Priscian goes on to give instances of confusion
between the masculine and neuter, or the masculine, feminine, and
neuter: guttur, murmur, glomus, fretus, dorsus, gelus, ,ΗΑ-ην, Rhenm,
Tanagrus, Metaurus, Iberus, Vulturnus, Oceanus, iubar, liquor, papaver,
penus, pecus, retis, sexus, specus, sal.

These lists are (with the exceptions noticed) alphabetical, and so far
resemble the third book of Nonius. And of the words thus catalogued
by Priscian in this passage, thirty-one out of seventy-two are to be found
in Nonius. 1 might have said thirty-one out of sixty-eight, for the words
platanus, populus, laurus, and aquila (which are absent in Nonius), are
intruded in Priscian in a place where, alphabetically, they have no right to
stand, the alphabetical order proceeding properly from cupressus to crinis.

Priscian distinctly tells us that he has taken his lists from Caper and
Probus: and it would, therefore, be easy to inser that the third book of
Nonius also comes from the same sources, But the question is some-
what complicated by the relations of the third book of Nonius to
Charisius, which must now be briefly considered.

CharisiuS, pp. 70-109, has a section in which, among other instances
of anomaly and doubtful usage in grammar, the question of words with a
double gender is discussed. The main chax acteristics of this section are,
(1) that the words are not arranged in alphabetical order, but in small
groups which are sometimes alphabetical, sometimes formed according
to the meaning of the ποι-(15, but often, as far as we can see, quite
casual, · (2) that stress is constantly laid on the difference in meaning of
similar words, or different genders, or different forms, of the same word3
(3) that Persius is the latest author quoted3 (4) that the latest authority
quoted is Pliny's work dubii sermonis: while Verrius Flaccus Iulius
Modestus, and Varro are not seldom cited.

On comparing this section of Charisius with the third book of
NoniuS, we find that upwards of forty words discussed are common to
