INTRODUCTION. 147

Any one who will compare the hundred and fourteen lines in
the Diosemeia, on the signs given by the moon and the sun, with
the thirty-seven in the F irst Book of the Georgics on the same
topic, will see at once that the two writers must have proposed
to themselves different objects. The first thought os the one
was to communicate information3 the first thought os the other
was to impart pleasure. ‚
In the case of a third writer whom virgil is supposed to Mc aad, χ
have imitated, circumstances have been less favourable to us,
Quintilian, in the well-known chapter in which he reviews the
various authors of Greece and Rome, asks whether Virgil can be
called an unsuccessful follower of Nicander. But of Nicander’s
GeorgicS, which is evidently the work referred to, we possess
only fragments3 and these, with the exception of one or two of
the least important, relate to any part of the subject rather than
to those os which Virgil has chosen to treat—to such trees as the
beech, the mulberry, the palm, and the chestnut, to turnips, and
gourdS, and cabbageS, to flowers of all kinds, and to pigeonS. We

- may agree with the last editor of the Nicandrea, Schneider, that

 

notwithstanding these specimens of his work, Nicander probably
went over much the same ground as Virgil, only taking a more
comprehensive view of his subject 3 but we have only Quintilian’s
authority for surmising that the resemblance between the two
poems extended beyond the name. Equally tantalizing is the
condition of our knowledge about another work by Nicander, the
Μελισσουργικά, the title of which promises to throw a flood os light
on Virgil's Fourth Book, while the notices os it that have been
preserved merely tell us that the author used θύμος, thyme, as a
masculine noun, that he applied the verb εὐφορέω, if the reading is
right, to the drones, in what connexion we know not, and that he
placed the original birth-place of the bees in Crete, in the days of
Saturn—the last point, at any rate, being one in which Virgil may
seem to have followed his example. But if we are ignorant of
those works of Nicander about which, as students of Virgil, we
should have most wished to be informed, we can at any rate satisfy
ourselves as to the general character of the poet by looking at
his two extant productions, the Theriaca and the Alexipharmaca.
Like Aratus, he appears to have been a metaphrastes; like him,
