129. ‘ Ipsa armenta,' the herd itself as
distinguished from its ‘dux' and ‘mari-
tus ς ’ that is, the mares.

132. ‘ Gallop and sweat them.'

133. Comp. 1 298. Col. 11 21 (22)
mentions the west wind as the best sor
winnowing. It seems hard to disconnect
⁶ sole fatigant ’ from ‘ cursu quatiunt,' and
refer it to the σονς, with Trapp and
Keightley, as is the recommendation were
to exercise them in thre-shing. On the
other hand, mares are put to horse in
s ring, long before corn is cut and
t reshed, so that this description os hot
weather as the time sor cutting and
threshing ,the corn must be considered as
33325313‘2325· .οὲἵῶὲὲῗὲἒῶ ’ὲῖζζὲξ
or autumn, may be threshed at any time,
e.g. in the spring.

‘Gemit' suggests the notion that the
threshing·floor eries out under the
‘ tritura.

138·156. ‘After conception the dams

violgnt exercise‚ and {llowed to graze in
the shade near water, and this in the
morning and evening‚ rather than at
midday, sor sear of the gadfly? Virg-
seems gradually to be sliding from the
subject of horses to that of oxen‚ v. 140
referring rather to coWS, vv. 141, 142 to
mares. The mention of the gadfly ap-

hear exclusively about calving.

138. No exact parallel for this use of
‘cadere’ is given. ‘ Cadere' and ‘suc-
cedere ' may possibly be a metaphor from
the setting and rising of stam.

140. Varro (11 vii ιο) cautious his
breeder against working his mares too
much when they are near foaling. ‘ Non ’
for ‘ne,’ 1 456.

‘ Plaustris’ seems to be ablative, as if
it had been ‘iuga gravium plaustrorum,’
not, as Keightley thinks, the dative.

141. It is hard to fix the exact sense of
‘saltu superare viam 3' it is probably to
be coupled with what solloWS, and taken
as clearing, i.e. leaping out of, the road,
[‘quod solet fieri cum pascunt pedibus
impeditis‚' say Serv. and the Berne
scholia.—-H. N.]

142. ‘ Fluviosque rapacis : ' from Lucr.
1 17 ς Virg. seems to have had his eye on
the whole os that passage. ⁴ Rapacis ² is not
without point, because the mares would
have to struggle to avoid being carried
away by the stream.

143. ‘Pascuntz’ a late corr. in Med„
Gud. corn, and others give ‘ ascant‚'
which Heyne retained. Wakeil.³ rightly
denies the Latinity os the subj. here, as
‘pascant ’ could hardl be understood
