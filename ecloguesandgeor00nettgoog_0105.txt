THE TEXT OF VIRGIL.

Oua authorities for the text of Virgil are twofold, the early manuscripts
and the ancient commentator& Besides these two classes, we have many
later manuscriptS, most of which, however, are almost worthless

I. The early manuscripts are seven in number, three fairly perfect
and four fragments, all written in capital letters. These manuscripts are
at least four centuries older than any other MSS. of Virgil, but their
actual dates are not certain. The square or rustic capitals with which
they are written are not easy to date with any precision, and, except the
puzzling ‘ subscriptio ² to the Medicean‚ we have no other evidence to
aid our judgment. Usually, however, these MSS. are ascribed to the
fourth or fifth centurieS, and the mistakes with which they all abeund—-
mistakes which in many cases imply a defective knowledge of classical
Latinity—point with much probability to the end of the fourth or
beginning of the fifth century. An these manuscripts appear to have
been ultimately derived from one archetype, itself full of variants and
corrections, but representing a text different from that followed by our
second class of authoritieS, the ancient commentator&

These manuscripts are:

(1) Med. or M„ the codex MediceuS, once at Bobbio, now in the
Laurentian library at Florence (plut. xxxlx ι). It commences at E. vl 48,
and is complete sor the rest os Virgi13 it contains scholia (added in or after
the seventh century) on the EclogueS, and at the end os the Eclogues the
⁴ subscriptio’ of Apronianus Asterius, dated ΑΛ). 494. The relation of the
‘subscriptio' to the MS. is uncertain: possibly it records a revision of the
existing copy by Apronianus, and owes its place at the end os the Eclogues
to the fact that this is the first blank page ε in this case the manuscript must
be earlier than 494 ΑΔ). 1t has been corrected by several hands; these
corrections are mostly either very early (denoted ‘ Med. corr! in the com-

Codex Mediceu5‚ Berlin, 1889), and, for parts of the Aeneid, by Henry
(Aeneidea 1 xiv foll.): in the present volume Hoffmann is followed. The
Medicean is usually held to be the best and most important of the early
manuscr] ts. .

(2) Pii. or P.‚ the codex Palatinus, once in the Palatine library at
Heidelberg, now in the Vatican (No. 1631). It is complete, except for
thirty-three leaves, which cause nine more or less serious gaps. According
to Sir E. Maunde Thompson there is no reason for dating it later, at all eventS,
than the fourth century. It and all the fivefollowing early MSS. have been
collated by Ribbeck.

(3) Rom. or R.‚ the codex Romanus, brought to Rome by Angelo
Politian, and now in the Vatican (No. 3867). 1t is complete, except for
