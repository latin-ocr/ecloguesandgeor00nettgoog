lxxxviii THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

Virgil, very little need be said here, the less as the few remarks which
are quoted from him by Servius can be shown to be, in all probability,
borrowed from other sources, Explebo numerum, in Aen. vr 545, Caper
took to mean minuam numerum .- an explanation which, as we have seen
above, is given by Nonius, p. 298. There is, however, nothing to show
that Nonius is borrowing from Caper here. And the same may be said
of Caper's remark on A. ιΧ 709, that the neuter form clipeum and not
the maso. clipeus should be read there, which coincides with N oniuS,
p. 195. F inally his observation (Serv. A. x 344, 788) on the forms fimur
and femen may be traced to Verrius Flaccus (Festus, p. 92).

Besides his elegant treatise on orthography, which has been fortu-
nately preserved, and a work de usu antiquae lectioniS, Velius Longus was
the author of a commentary on the Aeneid mentioned by Charisius
pp. 88, 175. Of this work several notes are preserved in Macrobius
and the Verona scholia, and much probably has found its way into the
commentary of Servius, For we find in several instances that where the
Verona scholia quote Longus by name, the same note is given in Servius
in an abridged form and without any mention of him: a phenomenon
which must never be lost sight of in considering the question of the
sources of the Servian commentary, whether the conclusion be that
Servius is borrowing from Longus, or that the notes os both are derived
from the same source. The principal notes of Longus preserved by the
Verona scholia are:

(a) A. 111 693 on the name Plemmyrium, which he (or his authori-
ties) derived from πλημὺρειν ‘ideo quod undique fluctibus undisque
adluatur.' This or a similar note is abridged in Servius without
acknowledgment.

(b) A. 111 705 on palmosa Selinus, palmosa being explained after
Melissus (Ρ) as meaning ‘the mother of· many victors in the Olympio

ames)
g (c) A. ιν 149. Longus derived segnis from sinc igni, and'explained
it as = deformt's, which again he took as coming from de and formas,
hot: and so Servius, again without acknowledgment of the source os his
note. So Nonius, p. 33.

(d) A v 488. Longus replied to a carping criticism of Cornutus on
this line. Again Servius gives the gist of this note without mention of
his authority.

(e) A. v11 489 on the word ferus for a stag. This note of Longus
seems to be based on the same sources as that of NoniuS, p. 307, both
quoting A. 11 52, where ferus is used of a horse. Again Servius
abridges this or a similar note without acknowledgment.

(f) A. x 1. Longus here had a valuable note on the words domus
Olympi, in illustration of which he quoted cenaculum caeli from Ennius

(g) A. Χ 551. Longus mentions and solves a difficulty about Faunus:
how could he be mortal if born of a nymph Ρ The question is also raised
and solved by Servius The gist of both notes is the same, but they
are evidently independent, and probably derived from a common source.

(h) A. x 557. Longus illustrated the local adverb istic by two
passages from the Rudens of Plautus.
