at rabidae tigres absunt et saeva leonum

semina, nec miseros fallunt aconita legentis,
nec rapit inmensos orbis per humum,lneque tanto
squameus in spiram tractu se colligit anguis,

adde tot egregias urbes operumque laborem,

tot congesta manu praeruptis oppida saxiS,
fluminaque antiquos subterlabentia muros.

151. ‘ Saeva leonum semina ’ (brood or
race) is an imitation of ‘triste leonum
Seminium,’Lucr. 111741.

152. Thereisaconiteinltaly‚ according
to Dioscorides tv 783 VirgJ s statement,
therefore, is not accurate. It is vain to
attempt to save his credit, as Serv. and
others have done, by laying stress on
‘’fallunt‚ for the context clearly requires
an assertion of freedom from poisonous
herbs.

153. ‘Tanto tractuss ‘that vast train,’
which he has elsewhere. Virg. appears
to be thinking exclusively of the huget
Se nts.

¹55· 1-57. ‘Think, t00, ofall those noble
cities and trophies of liuman toil, towns
piled by man ’s hand on precipitous rockS‚
and rivers that flow beneath time· honoured
walls! [Towns are characteristic os Italian
civilization: it is not clear whether Virgil
had special towns in mind. V. 156 suxts
many Central Italian cities; Byron per·
haps took v. 157 of the Cisalpine town&
Con. referred ν. 155 to Etruria.]

‘operumque laborem’ recurs A. 1 455.

[Literally, it is ‘the laboriousness of

human achievements. ']

156. ‘Praeruptis saxis congesta' is a
specific description of the position of
many Italian townS.

‘'Manu here implies labour, as else·
where violence (111 22), or care (111 395),
the general notion being personal exer·
tion. Hence its frequent use with‘ ipse.'

157. The mention of seas and lakes
immediately following shows that Serv.
is right in supposing here a special refer-
ence to the usefulness of the rivers. ·

161· 164. [Avernus was a lake near
Cumae situate in a volcanic crater and re·
nowned in legend (A. vl 237). Between
it and the coast lay Lucrinus, a lagoont
“ffizssinf‘fflisslff ἔξ, ἴὲξᾶῗῗάιξᾞῖιὲἑ
Saxificae, Strabo). In 37 Β. c. Agrippa
united the two lakes by a canal, streng-
thenedthedam(‘ additaclaustra' ), rovided
an exit and thus made a double bour,
the ‘ Iulius portus.’ The work was part
of operations against Sex. Pompeius: the
harbour was soon abandoned in favour of
Misenum. Avernus is still distinguishable,
but the coast was wholly altered by an
eruption in 1538. See Beloch's Cam-
panien‚ 168, Gardthausen' s Augustus ii
