be partners (see 1 31), or former partnerS,
of Meliboeus, not, as Serv. supposes,
partners os Corydon and Thyrsis.

15. Med. has ‘ hedos’ (⁶ agnos’ in the
margin) from a recollection of v. 9 and
perhaps of 111 82.

‘ Q, seems to be a predicate.
‘ Et’ coup es the two antagonistxc con-
siderations. Thyrsis

is the name of one
of the persons in Theocr. Idyl 1.

18. ‘ Alternis: ’ introduction to Ecl. 111.

19. ‘ Volebam,’ a variant mentioned by
Serv. ‚ is found in one or two inferior MSS.
and adopted by Voss ς ‘ volebant ' is
clearly right.

There 1s no need (as Ameis Spic., p. 14,
has rightly perceived) to supply ‘ eos ’ be-
fore · meminisse,’ with Wagn. and Forb.,
or ‘ me ’with S hn and Jahn.

‘ Musae,’ the uses os the rivals are said
to remember the amoebean strains, as
recalling them to the memory of the
shepherds, the Muses being mythologic-

ally connected with Memory, who was
their mother. Comp. 645, ‘ Et

proxima Phoebi

meministis enim, Divae, et memorare po-
testis.’ The language is worded as if the
shepherds had a number of verses in their
minds‚ and the Muses chose to remember
amoebeans rather than others ; but it must
not be pressed to mean that the contest
had been studied or rehearsed beforehand
(see v. 5, note). By the act of memory
probably no more is intended than the act
of cgmpogjtion, which Virg. elsewhere
(1 2, etc.)ex ressae by the word ‘meditari-⁹

21·24. ‘ or. Muses, grant that 1 may
sing like Codrus; is not, Ι abandon the
art.'

21. ‘ Libethrus,’ ‘ Libethra,’ or ‘ Li·
bethrum,’ was a sountain ἰπὶ-Βώρου, with
Qudnam hysmhffi-cx p· 629,
Α, το των Αειβηθριδων νυμφῶν αντρον.

Pausanias speaks of a mountain of the .

same name. The Libethrides are mentioned
as distinct srom the Muses, though equally
patronesses of song. So (x ι) Arethusa
ns invoked, and in Theocr. (vn 91) the
nymphs teach a shepherd so .

22. ‘ Codrus,’ v 11. [ e Verona
Scholia say that Codrus was understood
by some cntics to be virg„ by others to be
CornificiuS, and by others Helvius Cinna.
They go on to quote some lines of Valgius
upon this Codrus: ‘ Codrusque ille canit,
quali tu voce canebas, Atque solet nu-
meros dicere, Cinna, tuos, Dulcior ut
numquam Pylio profluxerit ore Nestoris,
aut docto pectore Demodoci,’ etc.—H. N .]

It signifies little whether ‘ proxima ' be
constructed with ‘ carmina ' supplied from
‘ carmen,' or taken as a verbal acc. after
⁶ facit.' With the sense comp. Theocr. 1 2,
μετὰ Πᾶνα τὸ δεύτερον ἆθλον dracoi.
