GEORGICON LIB. IV.

pulsus amor P quid me caelum sperare iubebas? 325-
en etiam hunc ipsum vitae mortalis honorem,

quem mihi vix frugum et pecudum custodia sollers
omnia temptanti extuderat, te matre, relinquo.

quin age, et ipsa manu felicis erue silvas,

fer stabulis inimicum ignem atque interfice messiS‚ 330
ure sata, et validam in vitis molire bipennem,

tanta meae si te ceperunt taedia laudis?

at mater sonitum thalamo sub fluminis alti

troduces a new question connected with
the former, not in any sense an alternative
tog-⁵· ‘ Caelum sperare ε ’ so Aeneas, the
son of a goddess, looks forward to deifica·
tion, Α. 1 250, κη 795. Burm. comp.
sen: H. F. 438, ‘quo patre genitus
ffsessmm lsperet domum,' spoken by Lycus
ercu es.

326. ‘ This crown of my mortality,' i.e.
this thingwhich veadignityto my
mortal existence, e praise of rural suc·
cess, which falls within a mortal’s s here,
and is his natural solaee under the imita·
tions of humanity. This seems better
than to sup with Keightley that he is
· speaking o the act os keeping bees in
particular, which would give an air of
triviality to the passage.

327. ‘ F rugum et pecudum custodia ' is
the poetieal ex ression sor a sarmer's lise ε
and osa farm slise hee-keeping is apart.

⁸ Pecudum’ Med„ Gud. corrected, and
Noniusg ‘ pecorum ' Pal. ,Rom. ,Gud. origin·
all , [and so ap ently the Berne scholia.
-ἷΙ, Ν.] The gr‘meris the common read·
ing. Nonius tries to show that ‘ pecudes '
= ‘ bees,' and some later lexx. have
followed him, but neither this line nor v.
168 jffitifies that sense, which would be
ve t.

ι3,,28. ‘ Omnia temptanti extuderat: '
comp. 1 133, “U’t vanas usus meditando
ἓξὲξέῗῗ russi& ‘¹091“0¹m23”²s⁵03{⁶ ἓξ
ano er.

⁸ Te matre, relinquo: ac si diceret:
sub ea perdo usum laboris, sub qua
augere de ueram-³ Serv.

3²9· ‘ Ipsa manu,' with thine own
hand, as probably in A. 11 645. ‘ Felicis
silvas,' plantations of fruit trees.

330. Fer . . . ignem‚' like ‘ferte
flammas‚’ A. lv 5942 With ‘inimicum
ignem' Mr. Blackburn comp. δῆιον πῦρ.

‘ Interiice messis z ' consume. Ursinus
{za ”35303353125‘2‘220205‘31’12 3212
facilius arbitror posse neque herbas arescere
et interfici! [So in Plautus, Lucilius, Lu·
cretius: it is the original sense, limited
later to killing.]

33¹· ⁸ Sata,’ as Martyn observes, com·
ing after ‘ messis,' probably refers to

yogffifitllffie ’ the first reading of Med.

gives ‘ duram,' which Ribbeck adoptS,
{Bepffissssdztffiffi ‘ffffl' ¹1⁰ ¹²ss3?
the alliteration favours ‘ validam,5 beside·
its external authority.

⁶ Molire ε ’ see 1 329.

332. ‘ Taedia ceperunt,' like ‘ dementia
cepit,’ E. 11 69.

33·347. ‘His cry reached his mother ’
as she sat in her cavern under the river
with ,nymphs round her listeping· to a
2⁰3·st {vfif‘ffiffiff mmm&
the eries of Achilles, though the Ν ereids
there enumerated are not sitting with her,
but are summoned by her shrieks.

333. ‘ Sonitum sensit‚' heard the sound.
It would seem from v. 353 foll. that she
did not distinguish the words.

‘ Thalamo ’ is explained by v. 374 to be
the chamber in which Cyrene was sitting,
which is supposed to be what we, by the
same metaphor‚ call the bed of the river,
though in the subsequent description it
appears to widen into a subterranean
region, containing the sources of all the
waters on earth. Cerda com . Soph- 0.
Τ. 195, where the sea is called
Ἀμφιτρίτας. ‘ Sub ’ then means undet
the roof of the chamber. The picture, as
Heyne observes, is drawn from the heroic
age, when royal ladies sat in their cham·
&rs spinning with attendants about
