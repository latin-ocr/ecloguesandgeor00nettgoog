P. VERGlLl MARON 15

ipsa placent; ipsae rursus concedite silvae.
non illum nostri possunt mutare laboreS,

nec si frigoribus mediis Hebrumque bibamus

65

Sithoniasque nives hiemis subeamus aquosae,
nec si, cum moriens alta liber aret in ulm0,
Aethiopum versemus ovis sub sidere Cancri.
omnia vincit Amor; et nos cedamus Amori.

Haec sat erit, divae, vestrum cecinisse poetam,

70

dum sedet et gracili fiscellam texit hibisco,
Pierides; vos haec facietis maxima Gallo,
Gallo, cuius amor tantum mihi crescit in horas

63. ‘ Ipsa ’ emphasizes the second nega·
tive clause, A. 1v 601, ‘non socios, non
ipsum absumere ferro Ascanium i· ' Songs
had formeri been his especial passion.
So ‘ipsae sifvaess because 1t is the whole
of woodland lise that he uarrels with.

‘ Concedite: ' ‘Conce ite atque absce-
dite, omnes de via decedite‚' Plaut.
Amph. 111 iv 1 : less courteous than
⁸ vivite silvae,' vm 59.

64. ‘ He is not one on whom any hard·
ships of ours (vv. 62, 65) can work a
change.’ Both hardship and effort seem
included in ⁸ labores’ here. ‘ Mutare,’ of
effecting a cha e in a person, A. v
679, ΧΠ 240. T e sentiment resembles
Horace’s ‘ Caelum non animum,’ etc.

65. From Theocr. vn 111, where the
subject is a menace to Pan. The HebruS,
spoken of by Hor. Ep. 1 iii 3 as ‘ nivali
compede vinctuS‚’ was, as Forb. remarks,
one os the first ice·bound rivers which the
Romans had encountered in their ex-
Reditions. Virg. may be thinking of

unting in winter, as m v. 56, but there
is nothmg to fix it definitely.

66. ‘ Memphin carentem Sithonia nive‚’
lior. Od. 111 xxvi 10. The second
{lllssssffedssbssilsscsssshssss‘t 33273321332
Latin writers.

‘Aquosae,' as Wagn. observes, is an
e ithet of an Italian rather than os a

hracian winter. ‘ Dum pelago desaevit
hiemps et aquosus Orion,’ A. ιν 52.
⁸ Torquet aquosam hiemem‚' A. lv 671.

‘ Frigoribus mediis ' belongs to this line
as well as the former, as ⁸ Hebrumque ’
seems to show. See however G. 11
119.

67. ‘When the elm is patched to the
quick,' ⁴ liber' being the inner bark.

⁴ Liber moriens,‘ however, is a somewhat
extravagant expression.

68. ⁴ Should ply a she herd's calling in
Aethiopia‚’ as Pan in eocr. v11 113 is
told παρ’ Αἰθιόπεσσι νομεύοις, with reser-
ence rather to his own habits than to their
fitness for the country.

⁴ Versemus‚' perhaps a translation of
the Greek πολεῖν. though the word was
doubtless chosen to express the long
(weng wandgrings of ¹anshepherd ih the

ese :see .111339o.

⁴ Cancri ι ’ ‘ Aestus erat mediusque dies,
solisque vapore Concava litorei fervebant
bracchia Cancri‚’ Ov. M. x 126.

69. ‘Since love conquers every thing,
change of climate, occupation and all,
why should 1 hold out? ' Med. has
‘ vincet‚' Rom. ⁶ vicit!

growing love for him! A shepherd must
not remain in the shade too long, and the
flock must be driven home.'

7ο. ‘ Divaez’ see on v. 9.

71- ⁸ Hibisco,’ 11 30. Basket·work is
the shepherd’s em loyment sor idler hours3
see 11 71. The ossject os the ‘ fiscella ’ is
shown b the imitation in Tibull. 111 15,
‘ Tum scella levi detexta est vimine
iunci3 {araqlue 1ι· ιιοκιέε est via facta
sero, .eeaso 0. vu .

7²- ⁴ slight as this is, you will make it
of highest worth for GalluS‚’ will give
it a peculim· charm in his eyes: ‘quae
Maxima semper Dicetur nobis, et erit
quae maxima semper,’ A. vlu 271.

73. ‘ My love for Gallus grows as fast,
hour by hour, as the alder in spring.'
Ursinus comp. Pind. Nem. v11140, αὔξεται
δ’ ἀρετά, χλωραῖς ἐέρσαις ὡς ὅτε δένδριον
ᾄσσει. Pal. has ‘ hora)
