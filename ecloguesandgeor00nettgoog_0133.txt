‘Otia,’ peace: com . Hor. A. P. 199,
⁴ apertis otia portis.' he ‘ deus ' is Octa-
vian. This is probably mere hyperbole,
though it heralds the adulation which
treated a lisgng emperor as a god. [See
p. 21.—-H. .]

‘ 87113181Εὲ ῒοὶὲὲιιιῖἓ ἓῗΑιΕὲΠὲἐ, ἔιηςιεεῢ
sostening the expression of the preceding
line. Serv. comp. Lucan’s adulation of
Nero (1 63), ⁶ Sed mihi iam numen.’

‘Amm‚' Theocr. Epig. 1 5, βωμὸν δ’
αἱμάξει κεραὸς τράγος οὗτος ὁ μαλλός.

9. ‘ Ille (mihi) permisit boves errare et
ipsum ludere‚’ the infinitives standing in
place of an accusative. This must not
be confounded with our idiom, ‘he per·
mitted my cattle to seed at large and me to
play,' where ‘cattle' and ‘me ’ are dativeS.

‘ Errare ' implies security, as in Hor.
Epod. 11 13 (quoted by Emmenoesius),
‘ Prospectat errantis greges.' In E. 11 21
it implies wealth.

10. ‘Ludere,’ frequently used os poetry,
vl 1, Hor. Od. 1 xxxii 2, half slightingly,
as os a relaxation. So παίζειν.

11-18. ‘Well, 1 do not grudge you
{13³3 2.,ξὲζί 3²...1012‘1333ssffxuss03‘355152
wearily driving my flock—one of them
has just dropped her young dead—not
but that Ι might have soreseen this. But
tell me about this god of yours.’

11. ‘Magis' used sor ‘potiuS,’ as in
Lucr. 11 428, 869, Catuli. vai'n 30,
where as here one assertion is rejected
and another substituted3 ‘ not' this, but
rather that.' [See Munro, Lucr. 1 612.]

‘ Non equidem invideo‚' κοῦτοι τι φθονέω,
Theocr. 1 62, which however refers to
giving a resent.

12. ‘ urbatur‚' the soldiers are spread·
ing confusion. Rom. and Pal. have ‘tur-
bamur,’ which is an old variant and was
adopted by Heinsius. But it is condemned

by Serv.‚ and Quintilian (1 iv 28) and
ConsentiuS, p. 372, give ‘ turbatur.'

‘’Ip’se' conffled with ‘undique totis

13. ‘ Protenus,' onwards; the primary
aar aaran 1 ..¹233-
ιν 1: and so Serv.‚ who explains the
word as =‘ porro tenus,’ seems to have
read in his copy or copieS. Nonius, p.
375 sv. ‘ protinu3,’ sa s that wherever
Virg. has ⁸ protenus‚’ e uses it in the
sense ’of ‘ porro, sine intermissione, con·
iffi. ²3¹3 ..2³:33ss3 ffissssinction 3533}
by some grammarians between ‘ protenus ’
and ‘protinuS‚' it being supposed that
‘ rotenus ’ was used of lace, ‘ protinus ’
oi) time (Caper De Ort . p. 100, Keil,
Schol. Bern. here). The notion may have
arisen from the variation of spelling found
in the text of Virg. A similar distinction
is made by F est. 258 between ‘quatenus ’
and ‘quatinus.’—l·1. N.]

‘ Aeger ’ applies probably both to body
and mind. ‘ Du00‚' the rest he drove
before him, this one he leads by a cord.

14. ‘ Gemellos: ’ Emmen. quotes
Theocr. 1 25, 111 34, where διδυματόκος
is· the epithet os a goat. Such goats
were fespilaecially valuable from their quan-
ti o mi k.

t{he use of ‘namque’ so late in the
sentence is of course peculiar to poetry
(comp. A. v 733), though it is laced
second in a sentence by Livy an later
prose writerS, unlike ‘ nam, which in
prose always comes first. [⁴ Corulos ’
Rom. ‘corylos' Pam—H. N.]

15. The kids, being dropped on the
stony soil, not on grass, would die soon
aster birth. Comp. G. 111 297.

‘Spem gregis‚’ ‘spemque gregem ue
