ECLOGA 1. [TITYRUS]

MELIBOEUS. TITYRUS.

THE historical groundwork of this Eclogue is the assignment of lands in Italy by the
triumvirs to their veteranS, in 41 3.(3. Place had to be found without delay for up·
wards of 170,ooo men (Appian, Bell. Civ. v S), and universal confiscation resulted.
The ‘spoliation,' says Mr. Merivale (History of the Roman Empire, vol. iii p. 222),
⁸ spread from the suburban lands to remote tracts, from municipal to private possessions.
Even loyalty to the Caesar-ian party proved of no avail: the faithful Mantua shared the
fate of its neighbour, the disaffected Cremona; and the little township of Andes,
Virgil's birthplace‚ in the Mantuan territory, was involved in the calamities of its
metropolis.’ The story, as told in Servius' Commentary, is that Virgil went to Rome
on the seizure of his property, and obtained from Octavian a decree of restitution‚
which however was rendered ineffectual by the violence of the new occupant, referred
to in the ninth Eclogue, so that a second appeal for protection had to be made.
[This is the traditional account, accepted by most modern critics. It is however
possible, as is argued in the excursus to the ninth Eclogue, that the ninth Eclogue is
earlier in time than the first, and that there was only one eviction (referred to in the
ninth Eclogue) and one restoration (referred to in the first). —H. N .]

The speakers in the Eclogue are two shepherds, one of whom is enjoying rustic
life, singing of his love and seeing his cattle seed undisturbed, when he is encountered
by the other, who has been expelled from his homestead and is driving his goats
before him, with no prospect but a cheerless exile. This is simple enough, but it is
complicated by an unhappy artifice. The fortunate shepherd is represented as a farm
slave who has just worked out his freedom z and this emancipationis used to symbolize
the confirmation of the poet in his property. The two events, with their concomitantS,
are treated as convertible with each other, the story being told partly in the one form,
partly in the other. See vv. 41 foll. and notes. This confusion arises from the identi-
fication of the shepherd and the poet, spoken of in the Introduction to the Ecloguoe :
but in the present case its very grossness has prevented its being observed by the
editors», who suppose Tityrus, like Moeris in Ecl. 1x, to be Virgil's ‘ vilicus,'who goes
to Rome to purchase his liberty of his master, and there hears from Octavian that
his master's property is saie—a cumbrous hypothesis, and not really reconcilable with
the language of the Eclogue. The earlier commentatorS, such as La Cerda and
Catrou, did not feel this difficulty, but they created one for themselves in the shape of
an allegory, according to which Tityrus' two partners, v. 30, stand for Rome and
Mantua respectively. Trapp, in rejecting the allegory, himself supposes that the
change of partners is intended to intimate a change of partieS, Virgil's abandonment
of the cause of the republicans for that of the triumvirs.
