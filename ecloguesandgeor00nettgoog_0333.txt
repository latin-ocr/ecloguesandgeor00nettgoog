LIB. 11. 225

HACTENUS arvorum cultus et sidera caeli,

nunc te, Bacche, canam, nec non silvestria tecum
virgulta et prolem tarde crescentis olivae.

huc, pater o Lenaee; tuis hic omnia plena

muneribuS, tibi pampineo gravidus autumno

floret ager, spumat plenis vindemia labris 3
huc, pater o Lenaee, veni, nudataque musto
tingue novo mecum dereptis crura coturniS.

Principio arboribus varia est natura creandis,

1—8. ‘Thus sar of tillage and seasons:
now of the vine, the trees of the planta·
tion, and the olive. May the patron of
the vine assist me, helping the poet as he
helps the vine-dresser.

1. ‘ Arvorum cultus ’ is the general
subject of Book 13 ‘sidera meli refers
to vv. 204-258, and perhaps to the prog-
nostioe which occupy the latter part of
that book.

‘ Hactenu5,'sc. ‘cecini.’ Comp. Aesch.
Cho. 143, ἡμῖν μὲν εὐχὰς τάσδε, τοῖς δ’
ἐναντίοις Λέγω, κτλ.

Rom. is wanting from this line to v. 215,
and till v. 138 Med. is the only extant
first-class MS. (except Ver. 92-117).

2. ‘ Virgulta :‘ Voss and Wagn. rightly
observe that the forest-trees are intro·
duced principally as forming the supporters
of the vine. so that there may be a special

ropriety in ‘ tecum.' [‘ Virgulta pro in·
filicibus arboribus posuit, quibus in Italia
vites cohaerent.' Berne schol. and Serv·
-H. N.] ‘ Virgulta,’ a number of twigs,
hence applied to bushes and low or young
trees, which here seem to be taken as
the type of such trees as the husbandman
cultivates.

‘ Silvestria ' seems to be used vaguely.

3. Hesiod, as reported by Pliny xv 3,
said that the ‘ sator ' <perhaps the sower)
of an olive never saw its fruit. Theophr.
De Caus. Plant. 1 9 called the olive δυσ·
αυξὴς contrasting it with the vine. Hence
Varro 1 41 recommends that it should not
be raised from seed (see below, vv. 56 foll. ).

4. ‘ Huc ’ may be elliptical, like δεῦρο =
but ‘ veni,‘ v. 7, smooths over the ellipse,
which is at least unusual.

‘Patert’ ‘Omnem deum necesse est
inter sollemnis ritus patrem nuncupari3
quod Lucilius indeorum concilio inridet
(Sat. 1 9, Miiller): Nemo ut sit nostrum,

‘l

Ianu', Quirinu’ pater, siet ac dicatur ad
unum,' lactant. lv 3. Compare the
equally general application of ἅναξ to the
gods of Greece. Virg., while showing
his ritual learning and giving the invoca—
tion an air of pontifical solemnity, doubt·
less thought of Bacchus as patron os men
andhgiver of increase to the fruits os the
eart .

‘ Tuis hic omnia plena : ' Virg. fancies
himself surrounded by the gifts of autumn,
of which he is going to sing. To conceive
os him as meaning that he actually writes
in autumn would be less natural. A
modern poet (Keats at the opening of
Endymion is an instance) might introduce
such a ersonal specification.

5. ‘ ibi ' seems to express the acknow·
ledgment of nature to its author and
sustainer; see 1 14 and v. 15 below.

‘Autumno’ may be tempora} or con-
structed with ‘gravidus' in the sense os
the sruits of autumn, like ὀπώρα.

8. ‘ Mecum :’ comp. ‘ Ignarosque viae
mecum miseratus agresti5,' 1 41, and
‘ una,’ v. 39 below.

Med. has ‘ direptis ς ’ see 1 269.

‘ Coturnis :' vell. P. 11 82, os AntoniuS,
‘ Cum redimitus hedera coronaque velatus
aurea et thyrsum tenens coturnisque suc·
cinctus curru velut Liber pater vectus esset
Alexandriae.' Bacchus was represented
with hunting buskins, which would natu·
rally form part of his fawn-skin dress.
virg„ professing to write with a view to

raetice, identifies the poet with the

usbandman, and invokes Bacchus at the
opening of his subject, as if the aid he
required were in the vine-dresser's occu·
pation.

9-34. ‘ T rees are propagated in various
ways, some natural, some artificial.'

9. ‘ Varia est natura ’ includes all the

quin aut pater optumu’ divum, Aut Nep· modes by which trees are generated‚ down
tunu' pater, Liber, Saturnu' pater, Mars», to v. 34. Of these modes there are two
