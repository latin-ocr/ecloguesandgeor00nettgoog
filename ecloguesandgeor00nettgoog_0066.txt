lxii THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

of Virgil himself, with the view of settling the question whether the ace.
pl. of urbs should be spelt urbis or urbes. He had probably also looked
at good copies of the Aeneid before he appealed to Aen. 11 224, 460 and 111
106 on the matter. His common sense is as notable as his industry. The
question, he maintained, would have been decided by Virgil not in pedantic
accordance with a fixed rule, but according to the judgment of his eas.

In Aen. vu 773 the undoubtedly true reading Phoebigenam, which is
“ found in none of our manuscriptS, is due to Probus It is difficult to
believe that he hit upon this by conjecture, or (to put the same state-
ment in another way) that Varius and Tucca would have allowed the
meaningless reading Poenigenam, which has taken possession of the
existing copies, to remain in the text of Virgil. The same remark
applies to his desence of flores crines against flavos crines in Aen. x11
605. Floras he defended by an appeal to ancient authors, and it is
worth noticing that Nonius», p. 109, has a note on florus illustrated from
Naevius, Is Nonius drawing upon the notes of ProbuS‚ as Ribbeck is
inclined to think he is in his seventh book, or are both dependent on
some earlier lexicographical authority Ρ In Aen. x 539, Probus was
doubtless right in reading insignibus albis, not insignibus armt's with Asper.
More questionable is his judgment in the case of Aen. 1 44, where he
would have us read transfixo tempore. not transfixo pectore. In Aen. 1
441 he rightly defended by an example from Sallust laettksimus umbrae
against laettksimus umbra (compare Servius (Dan.) on Aen. xi 338). In
vm 406 he (and after him Carminius) wished to read infitsum for
infusus. In lx 814 he defended aeger anhelitus as against acer anhelitus.
In G. 1 277 he read floreus, not Orcus.

These are instances of his power as a textual critic: let us now con-
sider some examples of his notes on grammar and interpretation.
Servius on the first line of the first Aeneid informs us that Probus (fol-
lowing Cicero and Caesar) laid it down that Ποία, Graios, Aiax, should
be written with ii: a scholar’s canon which is not supported by the
evidence of good inscriptions From this fact Ribbeck thinks it
possible that Gellius, when in 1v 17 he defends the orthography inibi-e,
subt’teit, obiia‘bus, may be following in the track of Probus (Prol. p. 139).
On Aen. 1 194, he made a distinction between the active and passive
forms of partio and other verbs of the same kind. It should be
observed that Nonius in treating of these words (pp. 472, 474) makes
no distinction between the two forms : a fact which suggests that he and
Probus followed independent sourceS, or that Probus made the distinc-
tion on his own judgment. The same is the case with regard to Nonius
in the note quoted from Probus on Aen. 1v 359, nemo haurit vocem.
Nonius, p. 319, quotes Virgil’s words ‘vocemque his auribus hausi ' as a
good instance of metaphorical expression, just as does Quintilian vm iii
54. In Aen. 111 3 Probus took fumat not as the present but as the con-
tracted perfect. On v1 473 he apparently had a dissertation on the
word pnlrtinus (⁶ de hoc sermone quaerit Probus et ahi? says Servius).
It would be interesting to know what relation this discussion bore to
the notes of Verrius Flaccus on the same word (Fest. pp. 226, 253).
In x 363 116 ingeniously remarked that vadi dorso was equivalent to
