156 GEORGICA.

especially distinguishes Virgil, it is eloquently maintained, is his
ardent and irrepressible love of the country. Not only is it the
animating soul of the Eclogues and GeorgiCS, but it haunts him
throughout the Aeneid, venting itself in a number of half-melan-
choly retrospecta and breaking out into ‘ a thousand similes!
He seems scarcely to wish to make his hero interesting, but he
is never tired of illustrating epic situations by the characteristic
beauties and delicate proprieties of natural obJectS. Nay‚ it is
even suggested that the event in his personal history which most
markedly connects him with the country, is likely to have had a
large share in determining the character of his poetry. Anxiety
about the safety of his farm was one of the presiding feelings in
the composition of the Eclogues: the tender recollection of the
past danger and of the scenes which he may have afterwards re-
visited hovers over the Georgics : gratitude for the protection ex·
tended to him induced him to make a sacrifice of his truer
instinctS, and undertake the Aeneid.

To attempt a full discussion of this opinion would be obviously
presumptuous in one who is conscious of his own deficiency in
the power or habit of appreciating external nature, and so is

touches which undoubtedly appear throughout Virgil's poemS.
Such a one, however, may perhaps be allowed to state his own
impression with regard to the prominence of the position which
the feeling in question would seem to have occupied in the poet’s
mind as unfolded in his works. The choice os a subject certainly
furnishes a primd facie argument that the subject, or something
connected with it, has been thought congenial by the chooser‚

tionS, referring, so tradition interprets the passage, to an aban-
doned intention of celebrating the ‘ Albani patres,’ the royal line
from which Rome was derived. Again, we may credit the state-
ment of his biographer that his parentage connected him with the
country, where his early life was doubtless chiefly passed, at the
same time that we see the fact to be susceptible of another use,
as showing how he may have been drawn to rural poetry, without
having felt a decided love for it. But it is difficult to conceive
