4 BUCOLICA.

to the writings of the Greeks, as to so much raw material, and
adapted to the Roman stage the entertainments which had alter-
nately delighted and terrified the populace of Athens, Horace
invites attention to himsels,¹ as an independent traveller along
untrodden ground, not as having discovered any measure peculiar
to the Latin language, any melody to which the thoughts of his
countrymen would naturally vibrate, but as having been the first
to display to Latium the capabilities of the Archilochian Iambic,
the Alcaic, and the Sapphic. So Propertius² speaks of Thyrsis
and DaphniS, and the rustic presents which shepherd makes
to shepherdeSS, names and things copied precisely from Theo-
crituS, as if they were actually a new world to which Virgil had
introduced him and his contemporaries of the great city.
Striking as the phenomenon is, the circumstances of the case
enable us readily to account for it. The Roman knew only of a
single instance of a national literature in the world ε it challenged
his allegiance with an undisputed claim, and his only course
seemed to be to conform to it, and endeavour so far as he could,
to reproduce it among his own people. It seems as if no parallel
to such a mental condition could exist in our larger modern
experience, where the very number of the models set before
us corrects our admiration by distracting it, and forces us, as
it were, in spite of ourselveS‚ to interrogate that nature which
underlies the many varieties of art. Yet we may realize some-
thing of the feeling if we go back to the time when the office of a
translator ranked as high in English estimation as that of an
original poet—when he that drew Zimri and Achitophel was
thought to have added to his fame by his versions of Juvenal and

¹ ‘ Libera pet vacuum posui vestigia princepS,
non aliena meo pressi pede. Qui sibi fidit,
dux regit examen. Parios ego primus iambos
ostendi Latio.' (Hor. Ep. 1 xix 21.)

² ‘ Tu canis umbrosi subter pineta Galaesi
Thyrsin et attritis Daphnin arundinibus„
utque decem possint corrumpere mala puellas
missus et impressis haedus ab uberibus.'
(Prop. 111 xxvi 67.)

The coarseness os the second couplet is characteristic, showing the sort of charin
which Propertius found in a poem of rural life.
