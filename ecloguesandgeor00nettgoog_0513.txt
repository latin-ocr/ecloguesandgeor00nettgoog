DIDACTIC POETS OF ROME. 405

victuros agimus semper, nec vivimus unquam?
pauperiorque bonis quisque est, quo plura requirit,

nec quod habet numerat, tantum quod non habet optat 3
cumque sui parvos usus natura reposcat,

materiam struimus magnae per vota ruinae,
luxuriamque lucris emimuS, luxuque rapinas,

et summum census pretium est, effundere censum.
solvite, mortales, animos, curasque levate,

totque supervacuis vitam deflere querellis

sata regunt orbem, certa stant omnia lege,
longaque per certos signantur tempora casus)

Not content with enunciating his discovery, he proceeds to apply it,
tediously enough, to the various events in mythical and historical times.
Without fate, he asks, could the fire have fled from Aeneas? could
Troy have been victorious at the very crisis of its destiny Ρ would the
wolf have reared the two brothers Ρ would Rome have been developed
out of a few cottages? could shepherds have made the Capitol the

A specimen of his narrative power occurs in the fifth book, where,

her deliverance by Perseus in a style which, as Bemhardy aptly remarks,²
reminds us of the show-pieces of Seneca the tragedian. These are
Perseus' feelings when he first sees the beautiful prisoner.

‘ Isque ubi pendentem vidit de rupe puellam,
deriguit facie, quem non stupefecerat hostiS,

vixque manu spolium tenuit, victorque Medusae
victus in Andromeda est. iam mutibus invidet ipsis,
felicisque vocat teneant quae membra catenas.

et postquam poenae causam cognovit ab ipsa,
destinat in thalamos per bellum vadere ponti,

But I must redeem my promise of analyzing an entire portion of the

poem, the first book.
Manilius proposes his subject, characterizing it very briefly as
