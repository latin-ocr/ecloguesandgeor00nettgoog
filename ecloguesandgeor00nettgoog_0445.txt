555. ‘Arentes’ points to the heat, v.
479. Rom. gives ‘ horrentes.’

560. As the context shows, Virg.
means that the flesh cannot be cleansed
or cooked: so Serv. [the Berne schol. and
most recent scholarsJ. Heyne and Voss
issupposet that destruction by water or fire

nigabrglzoe, [which Virg. is the first
writer to use, means elsewhere in Virg.
(A. 1 720; ιν 497; xl 7893 comp. vn
232) and in Subsequent authnm, to de·
stroy: here (Serv. says) it = cleanse. Its
original sense may be to wash or wash
awa . (Nettleship, Contr. to Lat. Lex.).
W& in, who accepts here the sense of
washing, derives it from ab ÷ oleo = to
grow‚ seen in ‘adolesc0,’ etc.: Archiv

Comp. v. 443, where ‘inlotus sudor’ is
said to cause ‘ scabies' [and poet. ap. Cic.
Tusc. 111 26, ‘ pectus illuvie scabrum. ‘]

562. In ‘telas attingere ' Virg. puts the
case os the wool having been woven, and
says that it would be useless; the webs
would break at the touch (Wagn.). There
is in sact a rhetorical climax—⁴ The wool
was too rotten to be shorn, or, if shorn,
to be woven, or if woven‚ to be put on,
or is put on, to be worn without contract-
ing disease.'

563. ‘Etiam ² oes bestwithv. 564: ‘not

produced inflammation.

[‘ Temptaret‚' Med. originally, and so
Ribbeck. ‘ Temptarat,’ Pal., Rom„ etc„
and so Con.—H. N.]

565. ⁸ Sequebatur ’ seems to express the
trickling of the sweat over the limbs‚
following (as it were) their course, as
Heyne ex laius it. There might be a
further re erence to these symptoms as
the consequence of putting on the gar-
ment—a mixture of ‘sudor sequebatur’
and ‘ sudor per membra ibat)

⁴ Moranti of the patient, who had not
to wait long before he was seized.

566. ⁸ Contactos' is explained by the
substantive ‘ contagium) [‘ Contractos'
pal„ and originally Gud.—H. N.]

‘Sacer ignis,’ akin to erysipelaS, but
according to Celsus v 28, not identical
with it. Lucr. vi 1167, compares the
ulcers in the pingue to the effect of the
