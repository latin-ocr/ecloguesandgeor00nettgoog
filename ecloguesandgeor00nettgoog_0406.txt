it is in point to mention them in the ease
of a stallion, whereas it would be a truism
in the ease of a racer.

The whole passage may be paraphrased:
‘It is equally difficult to breed chargers
and racers, and in either case the breeder
5:33¹? {321³ ιζὲἓᾝ, 3²:13¹ „352332312’ 0²53
even though in the one case he may have
been a capital charger (v. 120), or in the
other may be of the h· hest raeing breed
of Greece.' But the revity of Virg.'s
language, and his tendency to substitute
poetieal ornament for regular logical se-
quence, render the assage obscure, and
it is possible that oss may be right in
referring ‘ labor ’ to the training sor driving
and riding, the toil however being that of
the horse-breaker, not os the horse. In
that ease the connexion will be, ‘as the
two objects are e ually important, and
equally difficult o attainment, it is of
ἓξὲξ, messam “assessis
with Heyne of breeding and driving or
riding seems out os the question ε nor can
Wagn. be right in referring ‘aeque' to
‘que—que,’ ‘aeque iuvenem ae calidum
et aerem.’

120-122. These lines apparently refer
to v. 102, reminding the reader that such
considerations are to be attended to only
in the second place. There is some care-
lessness in the use of ‘ille ’ v. 120, which
is introduced so as to leave it doubtful
whether V‘ . meant to say ‘ they look to
the youth o a horse first. whatever may
have been his past services,’ or ‘they look
for a young horse, though the other candi-
date for their choice may have been dis·
tinguished in past times-⁹ Probably there
is a confusion between the two. A friend
of Warton'S, who observed this, wished
to place the lines after v. 96, and so Rib-
beck, following a recent tract by Tittler,
[and F orb. in his last edition—H. N .]

get him into good condition: mares, on
the other hand, sometimes require to be

exercise?

123. ‘ His animadversis,' i.e. ‘moribus
et aetate deprehensis,’ Serv. Pal. has
‘ animum adversis,' which Ribbeck adopts,
as also in 11 259, where the testimony of
Pal. is less explicit.

horse should be when in high condition.

126. ‘ Florentis ' is not, as Wagn. thinks,
an ornamental epithet, but indicates the
kind of herbage spoken of, e.g. vetches
