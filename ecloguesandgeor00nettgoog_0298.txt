P. VERGILI MARONIS

Praeterea tam sunt Arcturi sidera nobis

Haedorumque dies servandi et lucidus Angui5‚

quarn quibus in patriam ventosa per aequora vectis ’
Pontus et ostriferi fauces temptantur Abydi.

Libra die somnique pares ubi fecerit 110125,

et medium luci atque umbris iam dividet orbem,

Pal. has ‘ illum praeceps,’ which Rib-
beck adopts3 Rom. corr. ‘ prono in prae·
&ffissslliissimffi‘ff ‘ffiussisessssspssssffsssbl
H. N.] Rom. also has ‘ trahit for ‘ rapit.’

204·230. ‘ The husbandman has as
much need to know the stars as the sailor.
Sowin barley may begin when the sun is
in the auce, and go on till mid-winter:
flax aud poppies too, The ris' of the
Bull is the tune sor sowing 1102115, 0001110,
and millet. Wheat must not be sown till
the Pleiades and Crown are set: to attempt
it earlier leads to failure. Vetches‚ kidney³
beanS, and lentils may be sown from the
setting of Arcturus till mid-winter.'

[For the astronomical details see Dict.
Ant. i 228·232‚ ed. 3.]

204. ‘Arcturi‚' v 68, ὑπὸ ζώνῃ δέ oi
(βυώτῃ) αὐτὸς Ἐξ ἄλλων άρκτοῦρος ἑλίσσεται
ἀμφαδὸν ἀστὴρ, Atat. Phaen. 94. Both
the’rising and setting of Arcturus are at·
tended with storms. Arcturus says (Plaut.
Rud. Ptol. 71), ‘ Vehemens sum exoriens,
quom occido. vehementior.'

205. The Kids are two stars in the arm
of the Charioteer (λεπτὰ φαείνονται ἔξω
καρπὸν κατὰ χειρός, Α121. Phaen. 1 ) ς
they rise April 25111 and Sept. 27th·29th.
‘ Pluvialibus Haedis ³ A. lx 668.

‘ Anguis‚' v. 244, near the North Pole.

206. ‘ As useful to the husbandman 25
10 the sailor,' who first gave attention to
the stars, ν. 137. With the language

cotngecliisyl ἕξις 2 difficulty, as the

sailors have not returned home. The
words may mean ⁴ whose way home lies
over stormy water5‚’ stress being laid on
‘ ventosa per aequora‚’ ancl the participle
perhaps implying that they have sailed
home ere now, and so that sailing is their
calling. It may be simplet to say that
‘ vectis ’= ‘ euntibus ;' [the use of the past
for the pres. part. of deponent or semi·
deponent verbs is not uncommon, Madv.·

Rom. and 2 late correction in Med.
give ‘diei,’ which may be meant for
‘dii,’ 2 form introduced by some editors
in A. 1 636 (note). Charisius.. p. 126,
32 K, quotes the line with ‘d1e,’ but
seems to mention 2 variant ‘ dii ’ (genitive).
Gellius (lx 14) says in a copy reputed to
be Virg.'s own the read' was ‘dieS,’
which he parallels frommfinnius (Ann
401), ‘ Postremae longinqua dies confe-
cerat aetas! W'agn. inclines to this, re-
garding ‘ dies ‘ however 25 the acc. pl.

‘ Pares,’ referring to the 2010111021
equinox. So Lucan vlu 467, ‘Tempus
erat quo Libra pares examinat boras?

209. ‘Dividett' Rom„ Gud., and
another of Ribbeck's cursiveS, sor which
Heius. restored ‘dividit.’ ⁴ Dividit’ (Med.‚
Pal.) is preferred by Heins. and Wagn„
who adduces passages where ‘ cum iarn ' is
joined with a present. But the question
is not the propriety of the present by itsels.
but its propriety in combination with
⁴ fecerit,’ sor which we should have ex·
pected ‘secie’ On the other hand, the
combination of the fut. ind. with the so·
called fut. exactum is not uncommon in
Virg.: see on 1v 282. In tv 401, 2,
‘cum accenderit' and ‘cum sitiunt ’ are
not really co·ordinate. Accordingly, Ι
have accepted ‘ dividet,' though it must be
confessed that ‘ iam,'meaning that the 201
is just hap ning, goes better with the
present. he confusion of these forms is
one of the commonest in MSS.

210. ‘ Exercete 120105,’ plough for

sowing.
