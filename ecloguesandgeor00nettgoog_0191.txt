The further difficulty, the attribution to
Scylla, the dauggtgr ofuNitsus, oidssie
c rea a n o
the other Scylla, daughteryof Illipgrcus, is
not peculiar to this passage, the same
thing being done, as Cerda and Ruaeus
show, by Ov- F. 1v 500 and Prop. v
iv 39 foll. Consequently it is to be ac·
counted for either by the hypothesis of
different versions of the legend, or, as
Keightley prefers, by the Roman ignorance
of Greek mythology, not corrected by the
insertion of ‘aut 'before ‘quam fama secuta
est,’ which would be ungraceful, even if it
were better su ported than by [a mention
in Servius an a reading in Π obviously
derived from Sena—H. N.] Virg. some

not affect the argument.

75. This and the two following lines
are found in the Ciris, vv. 59 soll„ with
‘deprensos’ for ‘a timidos.’ The language
apparently follows Lucr. v 892, ‘rabidis
canibus succinctas semimarinis Corporibus
Scyllas.‘ Scylla is more fully described
A. 111 424 foll.

76. ‘ Dulichia& theships or ship (Od.
x11 205) ο εεςεζε,ι so called from Duli-
chia, or Dulichium (A. 111 271), one of

A question was raised among the ancient
critioe about the ap ropriateness of ⁴ vex-
asse‚' which is de ended, as sufficiently
strong for the occasion, by Probus ap.
Serv. [It is very probable that the long
defence of the word in Gell. 11 6( = Macrob.
vl vii 4 foll.) comes from the commentary
of Probus.—H. N.]

78. The story of Tereus was variously
told. The Greeks generally made Procne
the nightingale, and Philomela the swal-
lmu the Rom s r ver-sedV-thegrderssper-
haps, as oss suggests, from a false notion
of the etymology of Philomela. Those

who followed the latter version were
again divided, some keeping to the old
narrative and making Procne Tereus'
wife and Philomela her sister, others re-
versing the relations, doubtless because
they saw that the ni htingale must have
been the mother of t S, whose name is
the burden os her song. This last is
probably virg-'s view; he would more
naturally represent the wife than the

79. Serv. rightly disti ishes between
⁴ dapes ‘ and ‘ dona‚' the ormer being the
flesh of Q served up to TereuS, the
latter thehssad and extremities, presented
to him after his meal.

80. 1t is not clear whether Tereus or
Philomela is subject os ‘petiverit’ and
‘ supervolitaverit. The former is recom-
mended by ‘ mutatos artus,' v. 78, and by
the prominence apparently meant to be

⁴ Quo cursu ' may denote either the
speed of Philomelas night and Tereus’
pursuit, or the manner in which the fled,
as birds (⁴ uo' for ‘quali'). f the
former, whic agrees better with ‘cursu,'
we must understand ‘quibus . . . alis’ os
his or her return, after transformation, to
hover over the palace 3 then connect ‘ante'
with ⁴ sua' (Heyne comp. Ov. M. 11 491
os Callisto when transformed, ‘Ante
domum quondamque suis errabat in
agris'), a conjunction which will be less
harsh if we regard ‘infelix’ as a paren-
thetical exclamation. If the latter, ‘ ante '
may be understood to mean that, before
flying to the woods‚ the metamorphosed

bffiying round it. Ribbeck reads ‘ alte '
from his own conj.

The description of the bird flying round
the house might seem to point to the swal-
