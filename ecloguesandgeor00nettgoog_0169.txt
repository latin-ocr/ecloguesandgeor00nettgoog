46. ‘ Talia saecla,' ‘0 blessed es,’
in prose, ‘cum talia sitis, currite.’ his
use of ‘ talia ’ in the vocative may be com·
pared to that of οὗτος, e.g. Soph. O. C.
1627, ὦ οὗτος, οὗτος, Οἰδίπους, τί ’ ομεν
Χωρεῖν; Virg. clearly had in is mind
Catuli. LXIV 326, ‘ sed voe, quae fata
secuntur Currite ducentes subtegmina,
currite, fusi,’ though he has, as usual,
varied the expression, making the Fates
address the ages», though they talk to the
spindles. The rocess in each case seems
to be merely t t of ordaining the par-
ticular destiny‚ as a thing to come. So
ἐπιελώθειν is used in Hom. for ordaining.
The attempt of later editors, aster Cerda,
to bring Virg. more into conformity with
Catullus by making ‘ talia saecla’ the acc.
after ‘currere' is exceedingly harsh.
[Serv., however, says ‘ currite’ = ‘ vol-
vite.’-—H. N. And Symmachus ap·
parently took the words thus: Class.

48. So Augustus is addressed G. 142.
‘ Magnos honores ’ is explained by Voss
of the successive magistracies at Rome,
which is possible, however frigid it may
seem to our taste.

49. ‘ Deum ’ is used generally, as
Aeneas is called ‘ deum certissima proles,'
A. vt 322 (note).

⁶ Iovis incrementum‘ appears to be a
singular expression. The word is seldom

applied to a person, and it is elsewhere
used with a gen. of that of which it is the
beginning, as in Ov. M. 111 103. [Serv.
says it = ‘ nutrimentum‚’ and] Mr. Munro
§.Journal of Philology, vol. iv pp. 292
oll.) understands the expression to mean
‘ the germ of a future Jupiter,’ destined to
rule on earth as Jupiter rules in heaven.
This would agree with the meaning of
‘incrementum elsewhere (Mt. Munro
compares among other passages Q. Curt.
v i 42, where noble youths of the king’s
body-guard are called ⁸ magnorum prae-
fectorum et ducum incrementa et rudi·
menta '), but the thought would be ex-
travagant, expressing flattery which Virg.
does not bestow elsewhere, even on
Augustus. Meineke on Soph. ΕΙ. 1146
( . 266 of his edition of Soph. Ο. C.)
t inks the notionis that of the child re·
arded as an honour or pleasure to his
{ather Jupiter, and gives as the Greek
equivalent of the words Διὸς μέγα ὄφελος
or Διὸς μέγ’ ὄνειαρ. [The -Berne scholia
{2555ss 31¹3}0222522ffl‘ffl2132233
‘ cui Iuppiter magnam dederit incremen-
tum,' i.e. ‘ augmentum ε ’ ⁸ whom Jupiter
delights to honour. ‘—H. N .]

5ο. ‘ Mundum,’ the whole world, as
explained by the next line. Heyne well
remarks that the world is moved at the
coming of this divine boy as a sanctuary
is moved at the comin of its god. See
A. 111 90, vl 256. Possibly ‘bowing
under its weight of evil.'—H. N. So

tantur,’ observing that ‘nutantem' is
equivalent to ‘ ut nutat.'

51. ‘Caelum profundum,' ‘the azure
deep of air‚’ Gray3 but this is scarcely
classical. ‘ Profundus: like ‘altus' and
βαθύς, means high as well as deep,
[though it is rare in that sense, which
may have commenced with Virg. See

G. ιι 391.] The line recurs G. xv
222.
