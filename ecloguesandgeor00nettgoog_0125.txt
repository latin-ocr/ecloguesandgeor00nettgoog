INTRODUCTION. 17

will perhaps be found that further consideration will go far
towards justifying its truth.

If the Augustan age is, as it is allowed to be by common
consent, the epoch of the perfection of art as applied to Latin
poetry, that perfection is centred in Virgil and Horace. Ovid,
the third great representative poet of his time,sufficiently indicates
that even then a decline had begun ; and Tibullus and PropertiuS,
though free from his faultS, are scarcely of sufficient eminence to
be regarded as masters in the school of style. But Virgil and
Horace, like Sophocles among Greek poets‚ constitute the type
by which we estimate the poetical art of their nation, the mean
which every thing else either exceeds or falls short of. It is
not that we consciously fix upon any qualities in them which
attract our admiration, but rather perhapS, on the contrary, that
there seems to be nothing prominent about them; the various
requisites of excellence are harmoniously blended, without ex-
aggeration, and the mind receives that satisfaction which refuses
to be asked how it came to pass. Their style is sufficiently
characteristic not to repel imitation, though with many of its
most successful imitators the process is doubtless mainly in· ε
tuitive ε yet, on the other hand, it is not so peculiar as to render '
imitation an ,act of ridiculous presumption. Less frequently
pictorial than that which preceded it, the style of Lucretius and
CatulluS, it is at the same time more artistic: single sentences ·
are not devoted to the uniform development of a particular
effect, but a series of impressions is produced by appeals made
apparently without any principle of sequence to the different
elements of the mind, sense, fancy, feeling, or memory, and the Ι
task of reducing them to harmony is left to the reader’s sym· .'
pathizing instinct. It is a power which appears to deal with ¹
language not by violence, but by persuasion, not straining or ἶ
torturing it to bring out the required utterance, but yielding to
it and, as it were, following its humourS. Language is not yet
studied for its own sake: that feature belongs to the post-

 

 

Augustan time of the decline of poetry: but it has risen from
subordination into equality, and the step to despotic supremacy

is but a short one.
To enumerate the felicities which are to be found in the
