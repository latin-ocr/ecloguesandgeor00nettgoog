addidit expediam, pro qua mercede, canoros

Curetum sonitus crepitantiaque aera secutae,
Dictaeo caeli Regem pavere sub antr0.

solae communis natOS, consortia tecta

urbis habent, magnisque agitant sub legibus aevum,

et patriam solae et certos novere penates3

venturaeque hiemis memores aestate laborem
experiuntur et in medium quaesita reponunt.
namque aliae victu invigilant et foedere pacto

as in Cic. ad Q. F. 11 16, ‘quos situs,
quas naturas rerum et locorum,’ so that
it is virtually equivalent ἦ ‘ indoleS,’

probably used because the word is to be
taken distributively, as in the passage just
cited, though from Cic. N. D. 11 lvii
144, ‘ his naturis relatus amplificatur
sonu5,' it would seem that it might ex-
press natural qualities, as predicated of
any one bee.

‘Ipse:’ sect 121.

150. ‘ Addidit ' seems, from the con-
text, to be used in our sense os ‘ add‚’ as
if the bees had not had their nature
originally, but received it afterwards as
wageS. So ‘ virus serpentibus addidit '
1 12 .

( ‘Q9das’ is simply relative, not quasi-
iinterrogativffciightch accounts for the in·
ica ive ‘ a ι .’

‘ Pro ua mercede :' in simplet writing
we shotiid have had ‘ mercedem, propter

uod paverant,’ or somethin of the kind.

eightley well remarks, ‘ e makes the
bees—like men with whom all through
he assimilates them—to labour with a
view to the reward, instead os the reward
being a thing os which they had no pre-
vious conception, and which was given in
consequence of their labours.’ ·

Crete, and the Cretan elan of Κουρῆτες
clashed arms, etc„ to prevent his eries
being heard and his hiding·place detected
by Saturn (Callim. Hymn to Zeus 49 fon„
Lucr. 11 629, ovid Fasti lv 210, etc.).
The beeS, attracted by the sound (comp.
v. 64), came and fed him with honey.
According to another version, doves fed
Zeus with ambrosia, and were, in reward,
turned into the Pleiades]

153. The reference is to a community
of children, like that destred by Plato in

‘mores,’ or ‘ingenium’ plural is

his Republic, to which Serv. appositely
refers. This is accounted for by the faa
that the ordinary bees are not parents, as
will be seen below.

[The emphasis seems to be on ‘com-
munis’ and ‘consortia,’ tho h Con. laid
it ou ‘ urbiS,' dwellings unite into a city.
Technioally ‘ consortcs’ is used of coheirs
in an undivided inheritance or of members
of a ‘ societas universorum bonorum ’ =
Digest xxvn 1 xxxi 4, Geli. rix ‘ coibatur
societas inseparabilis, tanquam consortium
antiquum.' Here the word denotes the
pro thus held in commem]

eig tley observes that Virg. in his
anxiety to exalt the bees must have for·
gotten the ants, which the ancients tho ht

11101213255 examples of social prudence.

154. ‘ Mag-nis,’ ornamental, like τῶν
μεγαλων θεσμῶν Soph. Ant. 797, ⁶ mag·
num sas nefasque ’ Hor. Epod. v 87.
‘ They live under the majesty of law.’

‘Agitare aevum,’ A. x 235 3 see 11 527
above. Pal. omits ‘que.'

155. ‘Certi penates,' A. v111 39, like
‘ certa domus ’ A. vl 673. Thus ‘ novere’
is more than a mere synonytn of ‘ habuere,'
like ‘norunt’ A. vt 641, apparently in-
cluding both the recognition of the prin·
ciple ‘of 'patriotism and domestic life, and
familianty with the things themselves.

156. ‘ Hiemis memores? A tv 403.

157. ‘ In medium ε ’ with ⁶ quaesita? as
1 127 shows [For ‘ in medium ’ see A. xl
335 note]

158. Aristotle H. A. tx 40, διῇρηιφαι
δὲτὰέργα...ωαὶαὶ μὲν κηρία ἐργά-
ζονται,αὶδὲτὸμέλι,αὶδ’ἆριθᾶκην·καὶαῆ
μὲν πλάττουσι κηρία, αἱ δὲ ὕδωρ eipenno-
εἰς τοὺς κυπὰρους καὶ μιγνύουσι τῳ μέλιτι,
αἱ δ’ ἐπ’ ἔργον ἔρχονται. The division of
labour is os course a clear proof of a com-
mon purpose, cousciously or unoonsciously
realized3 hence ‘foedere pacto.’
