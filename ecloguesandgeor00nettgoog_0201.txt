BUCOLICA. ECL. VIII. 93

ECLOGA VIII. [PHARMACEUTRIA.]

DAMON. ALPHESIBOEUS.

WE have here the songs of two shepherdS, Damon, in the character of a despairing
lover lamenting over his faithlaes Nysa, who has taken a less worthy mate, and finally
resolving on sels-destruction, and Alphesiboeus„ in the character of a woman also sor-
saken by her lover‚· though only for a time, and trying to recover him by enchantmentS,
which at last prove successful.

[Serv. (on vv. 6, 10, 12) says that the poem is addressed to Augustus, but adds that
some critics took it as referring to Pollio. The reference to Augustus can only be
defended by an unnatural is not impossible interpretation of verse 10. 1t is much more
probable that the piece is addressed to] Polli0‚ in a preface running parallel with that
to Ε. vl (see Introduction there, and note on v· 7 here). Its date may be fixed from
vv. 6 foll„ which apparently point to the time when Pollio had gained his victory over
the Parthini in Illyricum (⁴victricis lauru8‚' y. 13), and was on his way home to
receive the triumph which he celebrated Oct. 25, 13.c. 39. Whether ‘iussis carmina
coepta tui5,’ ν. 1 1, actually means that Pollio suggested one or both of the subjects os
the Eclogue, or merely that he asked to have another pastoral written, is of course
impossible to say. b

The Eclogue itself is so far parallel to E. v that it contains a species of amoebean,
consisting not, like Eclogues 111 and vn, of a number of short effortS, but of two con-
tinuous strains of equal lengths—the difference between a dialogue and a set oration
followed by a set reply—-suggoeted perhaps by Theocr. Id. nc, where there are two
songs os seven lines each. But the detail here is much more complicated, each of the
poems being composed of ten stanzas (so to call them), consisting respectively of tw0,
three, four, and five lineS, and separated from each other by a burden.' The arrange-
ment of the stanzas however is not quite the same in the two poemS, as the last three
stanzas of Damon's song consist respectively of four, five, and three lines with their
burdens, while in Alphesiboeus’ the order of the concluding stanzas runS, five lineS,
three lineS, and four lines.

The circumstances under which this amoebean exercise takes place are not stated
(note on y. 14). The two songs have no formal connexion, though baffled love is the
theme of both. The first is imitated from various passages in the first, third, and
eleventh Idyls of TheocrituS, the second entirely from Idyl 11, which Virgil abridges
and fits with a more prosperous conclusion. The lynxes (v. 3) and the mention of
Oeta (v. 30) show that the scenery is no't national.
