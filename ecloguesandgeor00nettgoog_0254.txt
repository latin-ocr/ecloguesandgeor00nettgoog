146 Α GEORGmA.

tells uS, many others..¹ Of the two poems now in question, if
they are to be regarded as tw0, and not as one falling into two
partS, Virgil has been but sparingly indebted to the first, the
plan of the Georgics not leading him to attempt any description
of the stars as they appear in heaven, which is the subject of the
Phaenomena. But the other work, the Diosemeia, has been laid
under heavy contributionS, to furnish materials for that account
of the prognostics of the weather which occupies the latter part
os Virgil’s First Book. The very first words of Aratus’ poem,
οὐχ ὀρείας, evidently suggested the familiar appeal nonne vides,
which Virgil, in imitation of Lucretiu5‚ introduces more than
once in the Georgics. The whole of the prognostics that follows.
signs of wind, signs os rain, signs of fair weather, signs from
sounds by land or by sea, signs from the flight, the motion, or
the cry of birds, signs from the actions of beast3‚ reptiles, and
insect3‚ signs from the flames of lampS, and the appearances on
water, signs from the sun and moon at their rising and at their
settingrare all given nearly as Aratus has given them, though
the manner in which they are dealt with is Virgil's own. We
know not how closely Aratus may have followed his original, if
indeed he had an original in this as in his other poem ; but how-
ever much or however little scientific precision may have suffered
from his language, which is that os a tolerably successful imitator
of the old epic style, somewhat diffuse, but on the whole per-

· spicuouS‚ and not greatly over-wroughtgthe arrangement of his

subject is sufficiently like that which we should expect to see in
a prose treatise, so that the charms of variety are occasionally
sacrificed to the claims os practical utility, the same thing being
mentioned more than once where it happens to belong to more
than one cluster of phenomena. But·virgil pushes the right of
a poet over his materials far beyond Aratus, He delights in the
profusion of picturesque images which is to be found in Aratus'
collection os prognostic5‚ and he makes free use of'them for his
own purposes ; but those purposes are rather poetical than pro-
perly didactic. Is the reader is not wearied‚ it matters little that
he is left in ignorance of part of what it concerned him to know.
