THE TEXT OF VIRGIL. ciii

Π, but it is of little value (Kvicala, Vergilstudien‚ ng, 1878) ; Deuticke
Jahresb., 1882, 112 3 Chatelain, 74 A.)‚ and the great mass of cursive
MSS. is practically worthleSS. Such valuable readings as are to be found
in them are either derived from Servius and other commentatorS, or are
such as might easily have been restored, if necessary, by conjecture. The
term ‘ Ribbeck's cursives’ has been used by Conington and others to
denote the few comparatively useful cursives which Ribbeck and other
editors after him admit to their apparatus criticus and textual noteS.

The result is fairly satisfactory. We have in most cases the testi-
mony of early manuscripts, and of the recension or recensions used by
good grammarians and commentatorS, and this has preserved the text
from any serious corruption. In most cases of doubt, we have a choice
between two or more readings, any of which could be accepted without
violation of grammar, sense, or taste, and the margin left for conjectural
emendation 1s narrow. On the othei· hand, it must be remembered that
Virgil himself left some things unfinished in the Aeneid: errors doubt·
less arose in the course of publication, and it would be absurd to
suppose that the text we have is exactly that which Virgil left.

The following list (from Ribbeck’s Prol., p. 454) shows which of the
seven principal MSS. are available for the Eclogues and Georgics:
