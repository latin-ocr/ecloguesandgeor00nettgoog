THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. xcv

shown by a comparison of their notes in detail with notes in Festus,
NoniuS, GelliuS, and the grammarianS, such as that of which I have
attempted to give a specimen in the preceding sections, ·

1 8. SERVIUS.

The name of this commentator is given in all MSS. earlier than the
fifteenth century simply as Servius ς and Priscian in quoting his works
knows of no praenomen or cognomen.² The name Maurus Servius
Honoratus is highly suspiciouS, occurring as it does only in fifteenth
century manuscripts. A note of the pseudo-Acron on Horace, Sat. 1 ix
76, mentions a ‘ Servius, magister Urbis,' as offering an explanation
of the word antestari. Whether we have any right to identify this
person with our Servius is extremely doubtful.

Servius is introduced as one of the interlocutors in the Saturnalia
of Macrobius, MacrobiuS, who held high offices of state in 399, 410,
and 422 A.D., probably wrote his Saturnalia at the end of the fourth or
beginning of the fifth century. The dialogue, however, is in Platonic
and Ciceronian sashion‚ thr-own some twenty years back, being supposed
to take place before the death of Praetextatus (385 A.D.). Servius is
spoken of as at that time a man who had only recently adopted the
profession of teaching, but who had already acquired a high reputation
both for learning and modesty (Sat. 1 ii 15). He is described further
(ib. vr vi 1), as occupied every day in explaining Virgil to the Roman
youth, and the duty of answering hostile criticisms upon Virgil is, to a
large extent, assigned to him.

Ι am glad to find that M. Thomas has come to the same conclusion
as that for which I have already contended‚ that the Servius of the
Saturnalia stands in no real relation to the Servius of our commentary,
except in so far as the notes on Virgil in Macrobius can be shown to
be ultimately derived from the same sources as those in the commentary
of Servius (see p. xxxii). The idea that Macrobius is quoting from the
actual commentary of Servius cannot, I think, any longer be defended.
All internal evidence points, as Ι have attempted to show, in another
direction. Macrobius was himself, in all probability, using old com·
mentaries and treatises now lost, which were the source of many a note
in Philargyrius and Servius 3 and it was only natural, from a literary
point of view, that he should pay Servius the compliment of assigning to
him the duty of expounding this Virgilian learning.

Whether the commentary of Servius which we now possess was
published at the time when the Saturnalia were written is a point which I
do not think there is evidence to decide. If we take the language held
in the Saturnalia as seriously affecting the question, we must conclude
that in the year 380, or thereaboutS‚ Servius was known not as a writer
but only as a very learned teacher, and that his commentary was not
published until after the publication of the Saturnalia. But the character
