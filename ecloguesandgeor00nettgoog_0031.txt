LIFE OF VIRGIL. xxvii

polishing the Aeneid.¹ This done, he hoped to devote the rest of his
life to philosophy. But it was not to be. At Athens he met AugustuS,
who was returning from the East, and decided to return with him to
Italy. On a very hot September day he went to Megara, and afterwards
feu ill. He was worse when he arrived, after an uninterrupted voyage,
at Brundisium, where he died a few days afterwardS, on the zoth os
September.

Before leaving Italy Virgil had tried in vain to extract a promise from
Varius that if anything should happen to him, he would burn the Aeneid.
On his deathbed he constantly asked for his manuscript to burn it ; but
this requaet being also refused he left his writings in his will to Varius
and Tucoe, with the proviso that they were to publish nothing which had
not been already given to the world. With the sanction of AugustuS, if
not at his instance, Virgil’s last wish was judiciously disregarded, and the
Aeneid was published by Varius and Tucca, with such corrections only
as were absolutely necessary, even the unfinished verses being left as they
stood.²

Virgil is said to have been tall, dark, and of a rustic appearance.
His health was indifferent, for he suffered from weakness in the throat
and stomach, as well as from headaches and spitting os blood. Little is
known of his character, but what is known is (with doubtful exceptions>
in his favour. His own language about his poems in the Eclogues leads
us to imagine him fastidiouS, modest, and sensitive, and this apparently
was the general impression. The modesty of his looks procured him at
N aples the punning nickname of Parthenias. He objected very much to
the demonstrations made in his honour if ever he appeared in the streets
of Rome, an event, if we may believe SuetoniuS, of very rare
occurrence-³

He was a very bad speaker‚⁴ and failed completely when in his early
life he attempted the profession of advocate. But his reading was so
beautiful that ⁵ Julius MontanuS, a contemporary poet, said that verses

² Ibid. 39·41. ⁶ Egerat cum Vario priusquam Italia decederet ut si quid sibi
accidisset Aeneida combureret3 at is facturum se pernegarat. Igitur in extrema
valetudine adsidue scrinia desideravit crematurus ipse; verum nemine offerente nihil
quidem nominatim de ea cavit, ceterum eidem Vario ac simul Tuccae scripta sua sub
ea condicione legavit ne quid ederent quod non a se editum esset. Edidit autem
auctore Augusto Varius, sed summatim emendata, ut qui versus etiam imperfectos
sicuti erant reliquerit ἐ ib. 37. ‘ L. Varium et Plotium Tuccam, qui eius Aeneida
post obitum iussu Caesaris emendaverunt.’

semel, nam et in sermone tardissimum ac paene indocto similem fuisse Melissus
tradidit! ⁵ Ibid. 28-29.
