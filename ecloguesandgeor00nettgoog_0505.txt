525. ‘Vox ipsa,' the mere voice, as if
it were a separate organ, like the tongue.
⁸ Frigida,' v. 506.

526. ‘ Vocabat,’ not that he invoked
her in death (which the mode of the ad·
dress contradicts), but that he went on
lamenting her in death as in life.

527. ‘ Toto flumine,’ if pressed‚ seems
to mean over the whole breadth of that

art of the stream down which the head

oated while it retained its power of
speech. To suppose that the head ke t
murmuring on in its course down e
stream till it reached the sea, would be

528-547. ‘ Proteus ended and left him.
Cyrene remained to tell him the cure as
well as the cause os his loss. 1 t came, she

comforting him after the news of his
brother’s death. Here variety is secur'ed,
without departure from prophetie custom,

of his comminication is concemed, he is
too much the mouthpiece of the poet,

though the narrative is certainly so con-
ducted as to excite pity for Orpheus be-
yond every other feeling, and so to re-
present to Aristaeus the gravity of the
occasion.

529. ‘Torsit sub vertice τ’ quod vulgari
usu, vortice vel in vorticem, ita ut vortex
fieret (Heyne). ProteuS, diving to the
depth, is said to wreath the water in foam
under the eddy, the poet’s object being to
give the two image5‚ of a body shooting

down and sending up water, and of the ,

eddy that agitates the surface.

‘Ultro adfata, spoke without waiting
to be addressed, spoke at once.
