P. VERGILI MARONIS

necte, Amarylli, mod0, et, ‘ Veneris,' dic, ‘ vincula necto.'
ducite ab urbe domum, mea carmina, ducite Daphnim. 80
limus ut hic durescit et haec ut cera liquescit

uno eodemque igni, sic nostro Daphnis amore.
sparge molam, et fragilis incende bitumine laurus,
Daphnis me malus urit, ego hanc in Daphnide laurum.
ducite ab urbe domum, mea carmina, ducite Daphnim. 85
talis amor Daphnim, qualis cum sessa iuvencum

per nemora atque altos quaerendo bucula lucos
propter aquae rivum viridi procumbit in ulva,
perdita, nec serae meminit decedere nocti,

79. ‘ Modo’ em hasizes the command
thus repeated. ‚⁴ ust twine them.' ‘1
mod0,’ Plaut. Trin. 11 iv 182.

‘Veneris vincula: ’ sor other allusions
to these knots, Voss refers to SynesiuS,
ff. 121, and Apuleius», Met. 111 137.
πάξοέἱῗαεεῗὲιὶὶ λιῗγεὴἓὲτῖἓιῖῗιῶιλιφιῖἔί
ὀστέα πάσσω. The early critics were
anxious to read ⁸ nodos’ for ‘ mod0,' and
had recourse to various devices to account
sor the mette.

81-85. ‘ 1 put clay, wax, and hay-leaves
into the fure, each to work acorresponding
effect on Daphnis!

81. Some commentators explain ‘limus’
and ‘cera' of images of clay and wax;
but Keightley rightly denies that any
more is meant than pieces of clay and
wax, which are put into the fire like the

11 28, Ὦς τ’·ὀ-ῦτον τὸν παρὸν ἐγὼ σὺν δαίμονι
niuem, Ως rdaemo’ ὑπ’ ἔρωτος ὀ Μύνδιος
αὐτίκα Δέλφις.

The rhyme is meant to imitate the
jingle usual in charms, as'Voss remarkS,
comparing Cat0, R. R. 160, where some
seemingly unmeaning specimens of the
sort are given. [Comp. Varro R. R. 1 ii
27, ‘terra pestem tenet0‚ salus hic ma-
nea? '⁸ ἒοῗῗῐιζῗῖῗίἓζξῦιὲἷῑιέ 6·5ί1;1ηα eadem·
’ qufo'i'dz' ' ξι.) ,ιξῑὲξζὶιγ love act in two ways,
softening Daphnis to me and hardening
him to others· voss.

83. ‘ Sparge molam ε ’ ‹ima-d τοι πρᾶτον
πυρὶ τάκεται· ἀλλ’ ἐπίπασσε, Theocr. 11
18. For ‘mola,' in sacrificeS, comp. A.
11 133, 1v 517.

‘ F ragilis,’ crackling. ‘ Et fragilis soni-

tus chartarum commeditatur,' Lucr. vi
112. Ray-imves were thrown on the
altar, and their crackling was thought
auspicious. ‘ Et succensa sacris crepitet
bene laurea flammiS, Omine quo felix et
sacer annus eat. Laurus», io, bona signa
dedit: gaudete, coloni,' Tibull. 11 v 81
foll. Comp. also Theocr. 11 24.

[‘LaurOS,' Pal„ Gud. and Ribbeck's
chief cursives, see VI 83.—H. N.]

84. Δέλφιςέ ’ἀνὶασεν, ἐγὼ δ’ ἐπὶ Aaou&
δάφναν Αἶθω, heocr. 11 23· Ἐπὶ Δὲλφιδι
explains ‘in Daphnide,' in the case of
Daphnis„ like ‘ talis in hoste suit Ptiam0‚’
A. 11 541. There may bea play intended
between ‘ Daphnis ' and δάφνη.

86—91. ‘May Daphnis' longing be like
the heil'er's, who, tired with secking her
mate in vain, throws herself on the grass,
and will not return to her stall.'

86. Virg. must mean that the heiser is
secking her mate, like Easiphae vl 52 foll. ;
but the picture is not unlike the cele-
brated one in Lucr. 11 352 soll. (com-

ared by Cerda)‚ of a cow looking for
fier lost calf, ‘ desiderio perfixa iuvenci.’

87. ⁴ Bucula,' G. 1 375.

88. ‘ Propter aquae rivum‚’ Lucr. 11
30. Pal. originally had ‘ concumbit,’
and so the text of Gud.

89. This line is said by Macrob. Sat.
v1 2 to be taken from Varius’ poem De
Morte Caesari& where a dog chasing a

. . ι .
ἓξὲξ ¹¹¹¹¹¹¹¹N aare?
serae meminit decedere nocti.' If so,
Virg. must be held to have proved his
right to the line by the use he has made of
it. The thought, the turn of the expres-
sion, and the rhythm of the verse, are all
better suited to the love-stricken heifer

than to the eager hound. The word
