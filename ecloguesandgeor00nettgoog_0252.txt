surmise that he would not have given a paragraph to the subject
at all, but for his deference to the example of Hesiod. The

‘³ ¹ ' famous stor-m-piece in the Georgics was evidently suggested by

the winter-piece in the Works and DayS, both being introduced
to warn the farmer of the dangers to which he is liable in his
calling, while each is evidently intended by its author as a
specimen of elaborate description, at the same time that it is
curious to contrast Virgil's rapid enumeration of the more
striking features of the scene, the continuous burst of rain, the
levelling of the cropS, the swelling of torrent and sea, the flashing
of the lightning, the terror of man and beast, the fall of the
mountain peak, and the howling of the wind, with the Dutch
fidelity of drawing with which Hesiod represented a single point,
the effect of the sleet on the animaIS, how it piet-ces some and
fails to pierce otherS, and how the wilder sort scud to their denS,
like an old man moving on three legs, with his back rather
broken than bent‚ and his head looking down to the ground.
Not less instructive is the parallel between the two poets in the
lines where they speak of the coming in of the warm weather,
‘ when lambs and goats are at their fattest, and wine at its
mellowest.’ Mt. Ruskin might appeal to the seque] of the pas-
sage in Hesiod, the wish for a sheltering rock, and wine of
Biblos, and a cake raised by yeast‚ and goat's milk, and the
flesh of a cow that has not yet calved, and of firstling kids, as a
proof of the utter subordination of any feeling of the picturesque
in the early Greek mind to a sense of physical comfort ; while it
would be only just to note that Virgil‚ in talking of the pleasure
of mid-day sleep, and of the thickness of the shadowing foliage
on the mountainS, has at any rate omitted the grosser and more
purely corporeal accessories of meat and drink. Virgil may be
said also to follow Hesiod in his natural calendar, generally
fixing the time of the year by the rising or setting of some star,
and once or twice noting the return of a season by the return of
a bird, such as the stork or the swallow. As in the EclogueS,
the stately march of his diction has in it nothing of agricultural
simplicity; yet there are instances in which he has imitated the
proverbial quaintness of some of Hesiod's sayingS, and expressed

an epigrammatic precept in language of no less point and terse-
