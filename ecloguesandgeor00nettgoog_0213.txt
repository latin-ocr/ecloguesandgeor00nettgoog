ECL. VIII. 105-

nescio quid certe est, et Hylax in limine latrat.
credimus? an, qui arn-ant, ipsi sibi somnia fingunt?
parcite, ab urbe venit, iam, carmina, parcite, Daphnis, 110

mere dying cinders; hut a pleonasm
would agree better with virg-’s general
use of ‘ipse,’ and would here, as else·
where, be highly forcible in itself.

‘ Bonum sit ’ or ⁴ bene sit ’ was the usual
ejaculation. Cic. Div. 1 45 (quoted by
Emm.) gives a fuller one, ‘ Maiores nostri
omnibus rebus agendis quod bonum, saus-
ἓιιιιῐὶι, felix, fortunatumque esset praesa-

tur.'

108. ‘Nescio quid certe est ' is copied
from CatulluS, as it is copied by Persius.
This shows that the present punctuation
is the right one, as against Doring's ⁸ Nes·
cioqnid. . . certeestl’

‘ Hylax' is a natural name sor a dog,
like ‘Hylactor’ Ov. M. 111 2²4· The
MSS. have ‘Hylas‚’ but on the ortho-
graphy os proper names their testimony
is worth little: see A. 111 701. The

barking is·- in Theocr. 11 35, though the
connexion there is different.

[‘Qui amant :’ for the metre see the note
on E. 11 65.]

110. Daphnis is seen, and the charms
are bidden to cease; in Theocr. the en·
chantress is nnsuccesssul.

‘ Iam, carmina, parcite ' was introduced
by Voss from Med. and one cursive for
⁶ iam cite, oermina,’ [which is preferred
by Riffick, Thilo, and others.] Wagn.
defended the old reading by referring to v.
673 but the position of ‘tibia’ there is
evidently meant to answer to its position
in ν. 21, etc„ so that we may argue that
‘ carmina' should stand here where it has
stood in v. 68, etc.
