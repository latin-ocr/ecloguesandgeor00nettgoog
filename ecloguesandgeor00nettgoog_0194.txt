P. VERGILI MARONIS

Thyrsis ovis, Corydon distentas lacte capellas,

ambo florentes aetatibuS, Arcades amb0,

et cantare pareS, et respondere parati. 5
huc mihi, dum teneras defendo a frigore myrtOS,

vir gregis ipse caper deerraverat3 atque ego Daphnim
aspicio. ille ubi me contra videt: ‘ociu5, inquit,
huc adeS, o Meliboee! caper tibi salvus et haedi;
et, si quid cessare poteS, requiesce sub umbra. 10
huc ipsi potum venient per prata iuvenci;

3. ‘ Distentas lacte,’ the time was even-
ingg so v. 15.

4. ‘ Aetatibus,’ plural, each being made
to have his own ‘aetaS,' by a poetical
variety; a prose writer would have said,
⁸ ambo florente aetate!

‘Arcadem' therefore skilled in so , x
32. Arcadi-a was a pastoral country (ε μη·
λος, Theocr. xxu 157); Q, its patron,
was the god of rural song, so that shep-
herds who can mpe- ²1.an are naturally
ι made Arcadians. There seems also to
have been a law in Arcadia in historical
times( l b. 1v ompelling the study
of music, w ic Polybius thinks produced
, a humanizing effect on the people. Keight·
ley supposes that these passages of Virg.
suggested the notion which became cur-
rent at the Revival of letters, representing
the Arcadians as living in an ideal golden
age of pastoral felicity—a view very unlike
that taken by the ancients, with whom
the Arcadians were proverbial for thick-
witted rustic stupidity, Juv. νη 160, etc.
For the confusion between Arcadia and
Mantua see Introduction to Eclogues, p. 9.

5. ‘ Parati' is constructed with both ‘can-
tare’ and ‘respondere,’ ‘Qes' being-taken
gith. ‘parati or with cantares equally

second (‘respondere’) part in an amoebean
contest. This seems better than to connect
‘ pares ' with ‘ cantare,’ = ‘ pares in can-
tando‚' though the construction would be
admissible in itself, and is apparently sanc-
tioned by Nemesianus’ irrutation (11 16),
‘ ambo aevo cantuque pares.’ At the same
time the stress on ‘ parati ’ is chiefly in con-
nexion with ‘ respondere,' as that would be
the strongest test of improvisation: and
this makes the word more appropriate than
Schrader’s conjecture ‘ periti,’ which is
sup rted by x 32, and by Theocr. vm

. 6. ‘ Huc,' to the place where they were
Sltttl¹])ge·fendo a frigore myrtos ' created
difficulty as early as Serv. Probably the
scene is laid in the spring, when the ’ hts
are frosty (compare the wh' i o the
leaves, v. 1, the humming οιΡξΙὶἒξεεε, v.

to look after his trees as well as after his
flocks and herdS.

‘ Dum ’ is used with the present, tho h
the verb in the principal clause is in t e
pluperfect‚ as in A. VI 171 foll.

For ‘ myrtos ’ a few inferior MSS. have
‘myrtus3' but in this case the u e os
Virg. appears to favour the secon de·
elension. Compare V1 83 note.

strayed, and therefore the herd with him.
Heyne, referring to v. 9.

‘Deerro‘ disyllabic, as Lucr. 111 860,
[in Lucr. 1 711 spelt ‘dett-'.]

‘ Atque ³ used in a style of poetical sim·
plicity, where, in connected writing, we
should have ‘ cum.’ Other instances, col·
lected by Wagn., are A. 1v 66 3, v1 162, vn
29, x 219. [So in Plautus, Cic„ etc. See
Dr'ager ii p. 493 the rarer, mainly Plautine
use of ‘ atque ’ in apodosis (G. 1 203 note)
perhaps grew out ι of this] (Jebauer,

to :ai in the line preceding. Here the
sense is, ‘I had just observed that he
had strayed, when 1 caught sight of
Daphnis

1 1. The bullocks are those of MeliboeuS,
who must be sup to be in charge of
them as well as of the goats, and also of
lambs, v. 15. So Damoetas, 111 6, 29, is
both shepherd and cowherd.

‘ Ipsi ’ as in lv 21 (note).
