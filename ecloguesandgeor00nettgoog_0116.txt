they rose up within him, the suggestive guide that was to awaken
his slumbering powerS, and lead him to discover further felicities
yet possible to the artist. This habit of mind perhaps strikes us
most in cases where it is most slightly and, it would almost
seem, unconsciously indicated. More than one writer has
remarked on Virgil's practice of characterizing things by some
local epithet, as a peculiarity by which he is distinguished from
the earlier Latin poetS. Doubtless in many instances there is
some special reason for the choice of the word : it may point to
some essential attribute of the thing, or some accidental con-
nexion with time and place which has a real significance in the
context. But there are others where it is not easy to perceive
any such relevancy. What appropriateness can there be in
describing the hedge which separates Tityrus' farm from his
neighbour's as having its willow-blossoms fed upon by the bees
os Hybla,¹ or in the wish that the swarms which Moeris has to
look aster may avoid the yews os Corsica? ² The epithet here is
significant not to the reader but to the poet, or to the reader
only so far as he happens to share in the poet’s intellectual
antecedents: it appeals not to a first-hand appreciation os the
characteristics of natural ‚object5, such as is open to all, but to
information gained from reading or travel, and therefore con·
fined to a few. And from what we know of the facts of Virgil's
life we may safely conclude that, at the time of the composition
of the Eclogues at any rate, his associations were those of a
student, not those of a tourist. Nor would it be just to stigma·
tize the predilection which this indicates as merely conventional.
It may be narrow, but within its limits it is genuine. There are
some minds which are better calculated, at least in youth, to be
impressed by the inexhaustibleness of Art than by the infinity
os Nature. They may lack the genial susceptibility which in
others is awakened immediately by the sight of the world
without, and they may not have had time to educate their im-
perfect sympathies into a fuller appreciation 3 but they sespond
without difficulty to the invitations of natural beauty as con-
veyed to them through an intervening medium, adapted by its
own perfection for the transmission of the perfection which
