which cannot be made objects of censure.
Heyne argues that the point os the simile
lies in the work done, and that the bees
are intended to gain by the juxtaposition.
N either desenoe appears satisfactory. The
first seems to assume, what is certainly
not the case, that in order to condemn
the poet we must feel a personal resent-
ment against the objects which he ex·
etates, as being ‘participes criminis!
he latter ignores the fact that it is the
compadson os bees to Cyclopes under any
circumstances that is objected to, because
the sense os what they have in common is
borne down aud overwhelmed by the sense
of their utter difference. 1t is true that
the similarity of bees and men is a thought
which, judiciously or injudiciously, is
made to run throughout the ; but

been already intimated on v. , that
