ΟΝ THE LATER BUCOLIC POETS OF ROME. 127

together with the pastorals of Calpurnius and Nemesianus), stated reasons
for restoring the whole to Calpurnius. The tide now turned: Burmann,
in the preface to his Poetae Latini Minores (Leyden‚ 1731), accepted
Ulitius’ view, though, like him, he did not venture in his text to disturb
the received division; and Wemsdorf‚ fifty years afterwardS, in his
preface cited above, and in an introductor-y essay on Calpurnius and
his Ecloguea enforced the same doctrine· by an array of arguments
which till very lately were generally supposed to have set the question
at rest. The main considerations on which he relies are the absence
of any mention of Nemesianus as a pastoral writer by Vopiscus, who
alludes to his other works, as well as by the earlier scholars after the
revival of learning, the fact that no MS. containing his undisputed
works contains these pastorals, the insufficiency of a single MS. authority,
the sels-contradictory character of the testimony supplied by the Parma
edition, which apparently shows that in that single MS. the arrangement
had been tampered with by a later hand, the similarity of the style of
the two sets of poemS, ‘ ut lac lacti simillimus‚' and the probability that
Calpurnius would write neither more nor less than eleven pastorals, that
being the number of the Idyls of Theocritus which may fairly be called
rustic proper—an argument somewhat recondite in itself, and depending
on a proposition which has itself to be supported by a good deal of
wire-drawn reasoning. So matters appear to have stood till the publica-
tion of Maurice Haupt's De Carminibus Bucolicis Calpurnii et Nemesiani
Liber <Leipsic, 1854) [in his collected works, vol. i pp. 358 foll.]. In
this monograph, which in its comprehensive knowledge and ingenuity
of conjecture is a fair specimen of the best German scholarship of our
day, the divided authorship of these Eclogues is strongly asserted.
Rejecting considerations grounded on the literary character of the
several poems as too dependent on individual taste to furnish material
for argument, the writer points out one remarkable peculiarity which
discriminates the undisputed Calpurnian Eclogues from the otherS‚ the
absence of elisions in any foot but the first, most of the few apparent
exceptions being shown either to arise from false readingS, or to be such
as really prove the mle—a degree of strictness transcending that of
Tibullus, LygdamuS, and Ovid, who are particular only not to elide
long vowels after the first foot, whereas Calpurnius does not elide long
vowels at all. From this positive proof of a distinction of authors, a
proof all the stronger as being furnished, as it were, unconsciously by
the poems themselveS, he proceeds to controvert Wemsdorf's arguments
for identity. Τὴε argument drawn from the supposed number of the
rustic Idyls of Theocritus he meets not only by denying the proposition
on which it restS, but by showing how easily a counter argument might
