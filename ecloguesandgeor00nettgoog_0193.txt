BUCOLICA. ECL. v11. 85

ECLOGA VII.

MELIBOEUS. CORYDON. THYRSIS.

Tuis is a singing·match between Corydon and Thyrsis, with Daphnis as umpire. Un-
like those in Eclogues 111 and V, it ends decisively in the defeat os Thyrsis. The
story is told by Meliboeus who was not present until the terms of the contest had
been agreed on, so that of them we hear nothing. The Idyls of Theocr. which Virgil
seems chiefly to have had in view are the sixth and eighth.

Attempts were made by the earlier critics to identify the characters, Corydon being
supposed to be Virgil, Thyrsis to be a contemporary rival (‘aut Bavius aut Anser aut
MaeviuS,’ according to theories mentioned by Sena), or even, according to Cerda‚
Theocritus himself, Meliboeus and Daphnis to be patrons os the poet. Serv. asserts
on the authority of the elegies of Valgius [Teuffel 241] that Codrus (ν. 22) was a con-
temporary poet [and some recent critics accept this vieW, taking Codrus to be a pseudo·
nym, Teuffel 2333 see also the Verona Scholia quoted on v. 22]. But nothing in the
poem points to any historica] basis ς all can be explained by supposing it to be an
imaginary Eclogue in the Theocritean style. There does not even seem to be any
necessity for supposing that, in introducing Meliboeus, Daphnis, and Corydon, Virgil
is thinking uniformly of the Meliboeus, Daphnis, and Corydon of former Eclogues,
though there is some appropriateness in making Daphnis the bestower of the crown os
poetry‚ and Corydon, the hero of Ecl. 11, its receiver.

The scenery is, as usual, confused. Arcadian shepherds are made to sing in the
neighbourhood of the Mincius», while neither the ilex (v. 1), the pine ·(v. 24), the
chestnut (ν. 53), nor the flocks of goats (v. 7), seem to belong to Mantua.

There appears no means of determining the date ς the mention of the Mincius does
not prove that Virgil was then in actual possession of his property.

This Eclogue is alluded to by Propertius (111 xxvi 67), ‘ Tu canis umbrosi subter
pineta Galaesi Thyrsin et attritis Daphnin harundinibus ς’ but the reference is
sufficiently vague, as the mention of Galaesus is apparently intended to recall a
totally different scene, that described in G. 1v 126, and the juxtaposition os Thyrsis
and Daphnis can mean no more than that Virgil introduces both, as Theocr. doeS,
though in different Idyls. [Mr. Munro, however, thinks that the mention of the
Galaesus by Propertius may show that some of the Eclogues were written in the
neighbourhood of Tarentum.—H. N .]
