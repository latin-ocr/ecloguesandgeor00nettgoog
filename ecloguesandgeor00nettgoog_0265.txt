INTRODUCTION. 157

that a man in whose mind the ambition of imitation, the charm
of recollected reading, and a taste for conventional conceptions
filled so large a space can have found his delight and solace, at
least to the extent supposed, in sympathy with external nature.
The unreality of the pastoral life in the Eclogues does not indeed
prove the existence of similar unreality in the Georgics ; but it
prepares us to expect, it. Probably there is no passage in the
Georgics in which sympathy with nature is more strongly
expressed than that to which I have already adverted, where he
contrasts the vocation of Lucretius with his own. He prays that
he may delight in the country and the streams that freshen the
valleys—that he may love river and woodland with an un·
,ambitious love. He sighs for Sperchius and Taygetus, the revel-
ground of Spartan maidenS, and longs for some one who will set
him down in the cool glens of HaemuS, and shelter him with the
giant shade of its boughs. He talks of the bliss os the man who
has won the friendship of the rural god3, Pan and old Silvanus,
and the sisterhood of nymphs, He occupies the rest of the book
with the praises of the country life, its tranquillity and purity, its
constant round of pleasant employments, its old historie and
legendary renown. But he has already painted the destiny of a
scientific inquiret into nature in colours which can scarcely be
intended to be less glowing‚ and declared that his first love is
centred there. The very distinctness with which Lucretius is
indicated as the ideal after which he primarily aspires is itself
a presumption that the aspiration is in some sort genuine.
There is, indeed, something strange and sad, if this were the
place to dwell on it, in the spectacle of a man contemplating the
Lucretian system and an attempt to realize the old rural belief J
as two feasible alternatives, and leaving the choice to be deter- ¹
mined by his mental constitution ε stranger, perhapS, and sadder
still, if we suppose him to be using words without a distinct
consciousness of their full meaning, and to be thinking really of
the comparative aptitude sor poetical purposes of the two opposite
aspects of nature. But though such a state of mind has no ·
affinity to the terrible earnestness of Lucretius himself, it is not
uncharacteristic of a would-be philosopher: while the touch
which immediately follows, the praise of a country. life as afford-
