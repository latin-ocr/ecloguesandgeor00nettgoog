xxxiv VIRGIL AND HIS ANCIENT CRITICS.

was either the De Verborum Significatu of Verrius Flaccus, or some
work immediately dependent upon it.

In the following chapter Virgil is defended on the ground os ancient
precedent for the use of several wordS, partly simple, partly compound,
‘ quae ab ipso ficta creduntur.’ The simple words are Mulciber, petulcus,
liquidus as an epithet of ignis, tristis in the sense of bitter‚ auritus .· the
compounds are turicremas, Arcitenens, silvicola, velivolus, vitisator,
noctiwgus, nubigena, umbraculum, disclud0. And a similar plea is urged
in favour of certain apparently new senses given by Virgil to ordinary
wordS, as to additus in Teucris addita Iuno .· to vomit in totis vomit
aedibus undam .· to agmen in leni fluit agmine Thybn‘s .· to crepitans in
crepitantibus urere flammis .· to horret in ferreus hastis Horret ager .· to
transmittunt in transmittunt cursu campos .· to defluo in tota cohors . . .
relictis Ad terram dfiuxit equis.- to deductus in deductum dicere carmen .·
to proiectus in protectaque saxa Pachyni.- to tempestivus in tempestivam
silvis evertere pinum.

Servius has short notes only on additus, horret, and umbracula (A.
v1 90, Χι 601, E. 1x 42 [Dan.]), which agree in substance with those of
MacrobiuS, but are mere abridgments of them. On liquidus Servius
(Dan.) on E. v1 33 quotes the same passage from Lucretius as Macrobius.

We may here notice some other criticisms of the same kind pre-
served by other authors. Gellius 1 ni 5 quotes a note os Hyginus
on the word amaror .· ‘ non enirn primus finxit hoc verbum Vergilius
insolenter’ (implying that Virgil had been accused of inventing the
word) ‘ sed m carminibus Lucretii inventum est, nec est aspernatus
auctoritatem poetae ingenio et facundia praecellentis.' Quintilian 1 v 65
mentions an objection to the word imperterritus, noticing the fact that
the two prepositions contradict each other3 and Servius on A. Χ 770
seems to be making excuses for virgil. So Servius v111 433 (Dan.) insta-
bant, ‘ nova locutiO‚ currum et rotas instabant.- ' Χ 835 (Dan.) acclinis,
‘ quis ante hunc ’ ? Χῐι 7 ‘ latronem, venatorem: quis ante hunc? Varro
tamen dicit hoc nomen posse habere etiam Latinam etymologiam,' etc.
Hyginus (ap. Gell. vn 6) blamed the phrase praepetibus pennis, which
was defended by parallels from Ennius and Matius, Gellius Χ xxix 4
says that in G.· 1 203 atque was thought obscure, and interprets it as===
statim ,· so NoniuS, p. 530. The phrase tunicam squalentem auro was
again defended by ancient example (Gellius 11 vi 19). Servius on
A. xu 517 (Dan.) says of exosus in that line ‘ quaeritur sane quis primus
exosum pro peroso dixerit,’ and (Aen. 111 384) excuses lentandus as
occurring ‘in annalibus)

From these criticismS, which attribute to Virgil the invention of new
wordS, or a new or rare application of old ones, we should be careful to
separate such remarks as that of Cornutus on vexare (Gellius 11 6 -ι
Macrobius vr vii 4) ‘incuriose et abiecte in his versibus verbum posuit ς ’
on inlaudatiBusin‘dis .· ‘ hoc enim verbum inlaudati non cst idoneum
ad exprimendam sceleratissimi hominis detestationem 3 ’ and that
quoted from the same writer on the words dixerat ille aliquid magnum
by Servius on Aen. Χ 547, ‘ Cornutus ut sordidum improbat)
