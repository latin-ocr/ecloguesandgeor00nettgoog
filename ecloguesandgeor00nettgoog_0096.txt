xcii THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

last part of the third century A.D.‚ as they mention Haterianus, The
fact that the names of Servius and Donatus never occur in them is, so
far it goeS‚ an argument in favour of supposing what their general
character leads us to presume, that they were written before those
Commentators appear on the scene.

15. AELms DONATUS.

This scholar, whom Jerome mentions more than once as his teacher,
lived and taught in the middle of the fourth century at Rome, where
he held the post of orator urbeis· Romae and the title of vir clarissimus.
It is unfortunate that we know nothing of his commentary on Virgil but
what we learn from the remarkS, mostly polemical‚ of Servius.¹ He
prefixed to his commentary the Life of Virgil which scholars are now
agreed was the work of Suetonius² This fact, as well as the character
of his commentary on Terence, would have led us to expect a work os
sound scholarship from Aelius Donatus: yet, if we may believe Servius,
he was weak both in knowledge and in judgment. On A. 11 798, for
instance, he seems to have expressed an opinion that ex llio might
stand as a metrical equivalent for exilio ‚· he thought that dtas (A. vm
642) could=d1btkaoe that litus (A. 11 5 57) could mean a spot before the
altar, and could be derived from litare ,· that Amsanctus (A. vu 563)
was in Lucania; that ‘trahunt in moenia' (A. ΧΠ 585) could mean
‘dilacerant in moenibus‚’ and so on. It is difficult to suppose that the
bulk of his commentary was not of better quality than this. Errors
like those just mentioned (and Servius himself is not entirely guiltless
of such mistakes) only show how surely the decline of scholarship had
set in by the middle of the fourth century A.D., and indeed (if the
work of Nonius may be taken as a specimen) much earlier.

16. TIBERIUS CLAUDIUS DONATUS.

The commentary of Tiberius Claudius Donatus on the Aeneid,
written towards the end of the fourth century ΑΛ). for the benefit of
his son Tiberius Claudius Maximus DonatianuS, differs in its scope and
aim from notes such as those of the Verona scholia, Serviu5‚ or Philar-
gyriuS. This writer's main object is to bring out fully the meaning of
his author by writing a lengthy paraphrase in prose, intended not only
to explain the meaning of the poet, but to exhibit the rhetorical con·
nection of the clauses, For instance, on Aen. 1 291 he takes pains to
show that the words of Jupiter, ‘quin aspera Iuno . . . Consilium in

of the younger (Ti. Claudius) Donatus.
