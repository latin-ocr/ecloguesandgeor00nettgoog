P. VERGILI MARONIS

sed picis in morem ad digitos lentescit habend0. 250

nec se praevalidam primis ostendat aristis!

quae gravis est, ipso tacitam se pondere prodit,

quaeque levis,

similar in sense to ‘ sapor,' to be needless
and ungraceful.]

‘ Tristia ' is proleptic. ‘ will warp the
mouths of the triers into disgust by the
sense.' [Comp. Palladius 1 v 3.—H. N.]

248. ‘ Denique ' belongs to ‘ hoc pactO,’
and means ‘to be brief.' The remaining
instances are despatched concisely.

word. There is the same liveliness in the
Lucretian ‘ iacere indu manus.’ ⁴ Manibus
tractata ’ occurs Lucr. lv 230, within a few
lines of ‘amaron ’ it is conceivable that
the whole passage may have been in Virg.'s
mind at the time of writing.

250. ‘ Ad digitos ’ is explained by the
notion of ‘adhaeret’ contained in ⁸ lente·

‘ Habendo ' [has not the same subject
as the sentence3 see Munro Lucr. 1 312,
E. vui 71, G. 111 454, Roby part ii p.

5 18, with a slight variety.

251. ‘ Maiores,’ higher than usual.
‘ 1psa,' in itself, as distinguished from the
particular luxuriance of the grass.

255. ⁴ Oculis' may be constructed as
dat. with ‘promptum' or as abl. with
‘ praediscere.' With the former interpre-
tation comp. Ov. M. xm 10, ‘Sed nec
mihi dicere promptum, Nec facere est

‘ Praediscere,’ either to leam before you
cultivate the field, or to leam at once.

256. ·](ἶυί’ is taken by Heyne as =
‘cuicumque,' and by Wagn. and Forb. as
= ⁸ cuique.' Both are unnecessary. lt is
a double question, as Ladewig takes it.
Misunderstanding of the construction led
at an early period to corruptions of the
text. Serv. mentions two readingS, ‘quis—
quis,’ which he declares to be right, and

changing ‘color’ into ‘c0103,' as if the
final ‘s' could be elided. The oldest
MSS. are similarly divided3 Med. has
‘ quis cuique,' Pal. and a late corr. in Med.
‘ quisquiS,' Rom. ⁸ quis cui cive ; ' one of
Ribbeck’s cursivoe gives ‘ quis cui ’ from a
corr. Ribbeck accepts ‘quisquis.‘

‘Sceleratumz ' Pliny xxiv 117, ‘Adver-
santur serpentium sceleratissimis haemor-
rhoidi et presteri.' 'l‘he word is however
probably half playful, and may be com·
pared with Hor. S. 11 iii 71, ‘Effugiet
tamen haec sceleratus vincula Proteus,’
and Plaut. Pseud. 111 ii 28, ‘ senapis
scelera . . . oculi ut exstillent facit: but
the text here is doubtiul.
