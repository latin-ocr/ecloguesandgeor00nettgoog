Cleobis and Biton, Hdt. 1 31), or whether
there was any thing analogous to it in
those parts. Keightley refers to Strabo ν,
p. 215, sor the existence of a grove os the
Argive Hera in the Venetian territory, and
to Tac. Germ. xx. for the custom among
certain Germans of having the ear of their
goddess drawn by cows.

buffaloes, but they were ill-matched. The

natural sense.

‘ Donatia,’ gifts, is used occasionally,
especially in poetry (Ov. F. 111 335 3
Lucan 1x 515), for laces where gifts are
offered, temples (as ere), shrineS, etc.

534. Pal. has ‘ipsi.’

535. ‘ Infodiunt,’ 11 348: here of bury·
ing seed in the ground.

537-547. ‘ Man has no longer to sear
beast, nor beast man, in the presence of a
greater terror. The sea throws up its fish ς
serpents die on land and in the water, and
birds in the air.’

537. ⁴ Insidias explorat ’ seems a mix·
ture of two expressions, such as ‘ insidias
struit’ and ‘loca ex loratz’ [explores the
lurking places.- . N.] ‘ Insidians '

‘ Acrior cura ε ’ disease is stronger than
hunger or thirst of blood. ,

539. ‘Timidi dammae,’ Ε. vm 28.

541. ‘ Iam ' serves for a transition as in
11 57, though here it may have a distinctly

the fish are ead or dying before they are
thrown upon the shore. Aristot. (H. A.
v111 19) denies that fish suffer from
epidemics, but later naturalists do not
agree with him.

1 481, ‘ washes before it.'

⁸ Insolitae’ would be a more natural

seals are cast on shore, not being able in
