xviii LI FE OF VIRGIL.

AugustuS, and memoirs of him by the poet Varius and other friends·
Fragments only of these original authorities have come down to uS‚
but, so fas as it goes, the information which they convey corresponds
accurately enough with that given by Suetonius.

Such are the sources from which Ῑ have drawn the following short

account of the life of Virgil.

ς 2. Publius Vergilius Maro was born on the fifteenth of October, in
the year 70 αα, in which Cn. Pompeius Magnus and M. Licinius
Crassus were for the first time consuls, at Andes, a pagus in the territory
of Mantua.¹ The name Andes is Cestio, and so apparently is Vergilius.²
The poet's father was a man of humble origin. According to some
accounts he was a worker in pottery, but most authorities represented
him as the hired servant of one Magius a courier,⁸ whose daughter
Magia he at length married. His mother’s name is doubtless in great
part responsible for the mediaeval notion which made Virgil (‘ Magiae
filius ') a magician.

If we may trust the authorities mentioned by Suetonius, Virgil’s
father managed to enrich himself by buying up tracts of woodland and
by keeping bees, There is nothing improbable in this statement,
as the time when he was thus engaged may well have been the era
of the Sullan proscriptionS‚ when land would be cheap. It is probable
that Virgil's love for the country was fostered by his early surroundingS.

Although of humble origin himself, Virgil’s father, like Horace'S,
seems to have been anxious to give his son the best education attainable.
Virgil spent his boyhood at Cremona, and took his toga virilis there on
his fifteenth birthday (Oct. 15, 13.c. 55), on the very day when the poet
Lucretius died.⁴ By an odd coincidence, Pompeius and Crassus were a
second time consuls in this year. From Cremona Virgil went to Milan,
and shortly afterwards to Rome. Here he studied rhetoric under the
best masterS,⁵ among others (if we may believe the short biography

The memoir attributed to Probus calls Andes a vicus, and places it some thirty miles
from Mantua. But Andes must have been much nearer to Mantua: see Anciem

common names in Cisalpine Gaul ; see the index to Corpus Inscr. Lat. V.]
