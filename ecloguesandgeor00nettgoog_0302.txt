P. VERGlLl MARONIS

semper sole rubens et torrida semper ab igni3

quam circum extremae dextra laevaque trahuntur, 235
caeruleae, glacie concretae atque imbribus atris;

has inter mediamque duae mortalibus aegris

munere concessae divom, et via secta per ambas,
oblicus qua se signorum verteret ordo,

munduS, ut ad Scythiam Riphaeasque arduus arces 240

οὐ μὲν ὕδωρ, ἀλλ’ αὐτὸς ἀπ’ οὐρανόθεν
κρύσταλλος

κειται αναμπεσχε · περίψυκτοι· δὲ τέ-
τυκτο. (κεῖτ’, αἶαν τ’ ἀμπέσχε Ρ)

ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν χερσαῖα, καὶ ἁμβατὰ ἀνθρώ-
ποισι.

δοιαὶ δ’ ἄλλαι ἔασιν ἐναντίαι ἀλλήλῃσι

μεσσηγὺς θέρεός τε καὶ issa-ion κρυστάλλου,

ἄμφω ἐΰκρητοί τε καὶ ὄμπνιον ἀλὸίσκουσαι

καρπὸν Ἐλευσίνης Δημητέρος· ἐν δὲ μιν
ἄνδρες Ἀντίποδες ναίουσι.

i 151. An unimportant fragment on the
zones from a m by Varro Atacinus is
garzrssaeyeft‘ssffi τε 3³:33) (w...

‘ Caelum,' because the zones of heaven
answer to the 2011ae of earth, and deter-
mine their character. Macrobius dis-
cussae the subject Somn. S. 11 7.

234. ‘ Ab igni ' is a translation of ἐκ
πυρός in Eratosth. We should have ex·
pected the instr. abl. So probably ‘ plu·
vioque madescit ab Austro,' Ov. M. 1 66.

235. ‘ Trahuntur' expresses extent,
like ‘tractu5‚' and is meant to translate
mssfffffgffssffleqe’ Med. Pa1. Rom.
Gud. ‘ Caerulea’ is only found in inferior
copiesz—H. N.]

‘ Caeruleus ' is used widely to express
various colours of a dull blue or green sort,
being to a certain extent, as Dr. Arnold
remarked‚ the opposite of ‘ purpureus '
(E. v 38 note). So A. 111 194, v 10, it is
used of a black stom-cloud (answering
to ‘ atris’ here); G. ιν 482, A v11 346, of
a serpent. The mention of ice seems
pggrehtppggpriaztgnte} tha} Keig utgaanoltp
serves: but irg. was doubtless thiynking
of the sky as the parent of ice. [The
rhythrn is like that of 11. 1v 281, Κυάνεαι,
σάκεσίν τε καὶ ἔγχεσι πεφρικυῖαι-Η. Ν.]

237. ‘ Mortalibus aegris,’ Lucr. vr 1,
Hom. 's δειλοῖσι βροτοῖσι. Comp. also A.
11 268, where there is a similar juxta—

. . ‚ ,
ffitfssssnz'ss ’Ἓξ ξῃῗῑξὲῗειῖἓάοὲᾅνὲἓιζ
the temperate zones to be abitable:
consequently, as discovery advanced, the
area occupied by those zones was ex-
tended‚ so that instead of five rts or
thirty degrees (from 24⁰ to 54⁰), t e space
originally allotted to them, they were made
to contain seven partS, to 66⁹.

238. ‘ Per’ is rightly explained by
Macrob. Somn. S. 11 8, as equivalent to
‘ inter,’ as the sun never enters the tem·
perate zones. That which goes between
two connected objects goes through the
pair. So v. 245, ‘per duas Arctos)
Comp. Ov. M. 11 130, ‘ Sectus in obli-
cum est lato curvamine limes, Zonarum-
que trium contentus fine, polumque Effu-
git australem, iunctamque Aquilonibus
Arcton.’

239. ‘ Oblicus ' with ‘ se verteret.' So
‘sese tulit obvia,' A. 1 314, ‘Infert se
saeptus nebula,’ ib. 4393 compare the
participle in such ex ressions as ‘ sensit
ostis,' A. 11 377.
The ordinary grammatical usage attaches
an adjective or participle to a noun as its
absolute property: here the adjective or
participle belongs to the noun only contin·
gently on the relation os the noun to the
verb. Thus in the present line the order
of the signs is oblique not in itself but in
reference to its revolution. The principle
is the same as in cases of prolepsis. The
language here is not strictly accurate,
as it was not the zodiac but the sun

medios delapsus in

that was supposed to move. ·

[‘ Oblicus Pal„ ‘ obliqus ’ Rom., ‘ obli-
quus ’ Med.—H. N.]
240. Vir . goes on to describe the
Pelea Nortffi and South, speaking of the
one as elevated and visible‚ the other as
depressed and invisible. ⁶ Scythia’ is
used for the North generally, as in 111 349.
