GEORGICON LIB. Ι.

nec fuit indignum superis, bis sanguine nostro

Ἧι

Emathiam et latos Haemi pinguescere campos,
scilicet et tempus veniet, cum finibus illis
agricola, incurvo terram molitus aratr0,

exesa inveniet scabra robigine pila,

aut gravibus rastris galeas pulsabit inanis,
grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulchris,

di patrii, IndigeteS‚ et Romule Vestaque mater,
quae Tuscum Tiberim et Romana Palatia servaS‚ ἕης

491. ‘ Nor did it seem too cruel 111 1110
eyes of the gods.' Comp. ⁸ Cui pulchrum
fuit 111 medios dormire 11105,’ Hor. Ep. 1 ii
30, and for the absolute use of ⁶ indignum ’
with the ethieal dative, ‘Sat fuit indignum,
Caesar, mundoque tibique,’ Lucan x 102.
[Markland conj. ‘ superi’ for ‘superiS,’
which is favoured by the remark of Servius
and the Berne scholia, ‘quasi exclamatio
est ad deos. ’—H. N.]

492. ‘ Pinguescere ε ’ Hor. od. 11 i 29.
Plutarch, Marius 21, says that Archi·
lochus spoke of the plains as fattened by
human bodies—perhaps the earliest that
did so. Aaech. Theb. 587, τήνδε πιανῶ
χθόνα, is sometimes taken to mean
this.

493. ‘ YeS, and the time will come when
in those borders the husbandman‚ as with
his crooked plough he upheaves the mass
os earth, will find, devoured by a scurf os
rust, Roman javelinS, or strike his heavy
take on empty heims, and gaze astounded
on the gigantic bones that start from their
broken sepulchres.’ ‘ Agricola ‘ is pro-
bably meant to recall the reader to the
real subject of the poem. In any case it
is an unconscious testimony to the arts os
hpsbandry as more permanent than those
o war.

494. Lucr. v 932, ‘N ec robustus erat
curvi moderator aratri Quisquam, nec
scibat ferro molirier arva.’ ‘ Molitus'
perhaps suggests that the relies os Phar·
salia would be buried deep by age.

495. ‘ Pila’ is emphatic; it was the
characteristic Roman weapon. So Lucan
1 7, cited on v. 489.

‘ Scabra robigine,’ Catull. vam 151.

496. ‘Inanis is emphatic, as the hol-
lowness would affect the sound‚ at the
same time that it reminds us that the
heads which wore the helmets have long
since mouldered away.

497. ‘ Grandia ’ refers to the notion that

mankind degenerated. JuV. xv 69, ‘ Nam
enus hoc vivo iam decrescebat Homero ;
erra malos homines nunc educat atque
pusillos ’ [and Mayor’s noteJ.
ha‘rrEfl'ossis,' broken into by plough or
our.

498-514. ‘ We have a Caesar yet: spme
him to us, ye gods, though ye may well
call him away from a world like 01115,
where right and wrong are inverted, hus·
bandry gives way to arms, war rages from
east to west, cities os the same land are
{immisit {wizai ῗὲῗῗίἕ
mastered by his horses.’

498. [Compare the similar invocations
in Ovid Met. xv 861, Livy v111 9, and]
Hor. Od. 1 2.

‘Indigetesz’ [this word, as used by
νὺξ-11, ovid, Livy, and others, seems
to enote national or indigenous deities‚
even including national heroes like Romu-
lus (A. xu 794), but the exact sense
was apparently unknown even in Virgil’s
time. The Roman scholars gave various
accounts, e.g. that it applied to all gods
alike, that it denoted LareS, PenateS, and
other gods whose special names were un·
known (so prob. Verrius F laccus3 comp.
Lucan 1 556): SerV. says ‘proprie sunt
dii ex hominibus sacti, abusive omnes
generaliter), Modern scholars differ
equally ε Mr. Nettleship derives the word
from ‘ m·dic· ’ i.e. one proclaimed asgod,
and suggests that originally it included all
the gods of Italian town5‚ but was later
reserved for the oldest (Contrib. to Latin
Lex. p. 483). See also Roscher’s Lex.
Mythol. and Marindin in Class. Dict.]

499. ‘Tuscum Tiberim :' robably the
old connexion of Etruria wit Rome was
in virg-'s mind here, as it obviously was
in the Aeneid.

‘ Romana Palatia :' the Palatine was
the hill of Romulus and his city.
