P. VERGILI MARONIS

corripuere ruuntque effusi carcere curruS,

curn spes arrectae iuvenum, exultantiaque haurit ¹05
corda pavor pulsans? illi instant verbere torto

et proni dant lora3 volat vi fervidus axis;

iamque humileS, iamque elati sublime videntur

aera per vacuum ferri, atque adsurgere in auras;
nec mora, nec requies; at fulvae nimbus harenae 110
tollitur3 umescunt spumis flatuque sequentum:

with their ever ready lash circling in the
air, bending forward to let the reins go:
on flies the wheel, swift and hot as fite:
now they ride low, now they seem to tower
alost, shooting through the void air and
rising against the sky: no stint, no stay,
while the yellow sand mounts up in a
cloud, and each is sprinkled with the foam
and breath of those behind him: that is
what ambition can do ς that is the measure
of their zeal for success’

104. ‘ Campum corripuere : ' have
started. ‘Corripio' in this and similar
{ztffiffinzff‘25225 germ {2232}ss
made, the ‘ vorare viam ' of Catullus

⁸ Effusi carcere ε ’ see 1 512.

105. ‘ Spes arrectae‚' a poetienl varietgy
for ‘animi arrecti spe.' So A. v 13 ,
which is a partial repetition pf this pas·
“gffuvffl‘lss'ff‘ffiss 3333233313‘335.. being
of course chosen to bring out the en·
thusiasm of youthful hopes.

⁸ Haurit' seems rightly explained by
Heyne‚ ‘ exhausts the heart by stopping
the breath.' Those who think this too
recondite may compare with Serv, A. x
314, ‘ latus haurit apertum,' the notion in
each case being that of rapidly devouri ,
so that here they may render, ‘ thril s
through and through.' ‘ Pulsan5,’ as well
as ⁶ haurit,' may go with ‘ corda.’ Virg.
borrowed the expression from Il. xxlu
³⁷⁰2>6Whffilp9wt2vetr ”rag-fimet gsdintrans.

1 . iius n: ea ostsseems
to begin here. strictly spgaking, how-
ever, the words commence a new sentence,
there being no grammatical connexion
with ‘nonne vides.² We have had a
similar instance in 1 187-189‚ ‘ Contem-
plator item . . . si superant fetus-²

‘ Instant’ seems to include the notion
of ‘insistunt rotis ’ (v. 114) as well as that
of keeping up the speed, and being always
ready to put in the whip.

‘ Verbere torto ⁹ is best taken as the
ablat. instrum. not as dat. sor ‘verberi'
Com . A. vm 250, x 691, the latter of
whic passages proves the use of the
ablat„ as the dat. of the person occurs in
the same sentence. ‘Verbere'=‘ ello!
‘ Tort0,’ ‘ circling,’ not ‘ twisted.’ mp.
1 309, ‘ Stuppea torquentem Balearis ver·
bera fundae,’ where ‘ verb! also=th

107. The teins were round t
body os the driver, so that he naturally
leant forward when at full speed. ‘ Axis ε ’
this was a very conspicuous part os the
ancient chariot, because the car was so
small and light. ⁸ Vi ’ is to be taken with
:yolats not, as Wakef. thought, with

ervidusss

108, 109. Homer(11. xxt11368 foll.) has

’Άρματα δ’ ἄλλοτε μὲν χθονὶ πίλνατο πουλυ-

βοτειρη,

Ἀλλοτε δ’ ἀΐξασκε μετήορα· τοὶ δ’ ἐλατῆρες
’Ἔστωσαν ἐν δίφροισι, πάτασσε δὲ θυμὸς

ἑκάστου.

so that Virg. refers to the bounding of
the cars and the corresponding rising and
sinking of the charioteers‚ not to any
motion os the charioteers themselves.

109. The words ‘sublinie—auras' are
a case of zeugma, being connected gram·
matically with both ⁴ humiles ' and ‘ elati,’
though tn sense with ‘ elati ' only. ‘ Sub-
liJne may be taken with either ‘ elati ' or
⁶ erri.’

‘ Vacuum' has nearly the same mean·
ing, deno ⁸ a certain height above the
ground. mp. Hor. Od. ι iii 34,
‘expertus vacuum Daedalus aera) Pind.
Ol. 1 10, ἐρήμας δι’ αἰθέρος-ε also A. v
{11ng111 592. [Rom. has ‘exsut-gere!—

110. ‘ At ’ is continuative, not adversa-
tive.

111. Comp. 11. xxm 380 and Soph.
El. 718. which passages show that this of
Virg.’s is literni, not rhetorical.
