 

THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ON VIRGIL. lxvii

are various points of contact between the third book of Nonius and
Verrius Flaccus. It is remarkable, aISO, that Verrius is often cited by
Charisius in the Section so often alluded to. The natural inference is
that Probus and Pliny both drew largely upon the lexicon and the
grammatical treatises of Verrius,

(2) Book v11. m: com-annus GENERmus VERBORUM.

This book mostly consists of notes upon verbs, which in old Latin
were used both as actives and as deponentS‚ or (in other words) verbs
whose deponent form was also used as a passive.

There are also remarks on other rare or antiquated verbal formS, as
reddt‘bo sor reddam, fite the imperative of fio and the like. There is a
remarkable coincidence between the lists of deponent verbs illustrated
by N ornus and parts of the eighth book of Priscian. We are confronted
here by a phenomenon similar to that noticed m the last section with
regard to Charisius. Priscian has two sections succeeding each other,
and dealing with precisely the same subject, and to a considerable extent
using the same instances The first of these begins 1, p. 378, beginning
at the words ‘ et ex his quaedam eadem voce utrumque significant, id est
actionem et passionem.’ After giving one or two instances of such
verbS, and a few of ordinary deponentS, Priscian proceeds, ‘ ex his multa
antiqui tam activa quam passiva significatione protulisse inveniuntur‚'
and then gives a list which is on the whole alphabetical from the letter a
to o .· auxilior, adminiculor, auguror, adhortor, apis-cor, abominor, conse·
quor, amplector, adorior, abutor, admiror, antestor, aggredior, aspernor,
architector, assector, argumentor, .reor, vereor, solor, arbitror, blandior, con-
solor, conspicor, comminiscor, completor, calumnior, carntficor, despicor,
demolior, dominor, depeculor, delargior, ementior, exordior, expet-tor, frus-
tror, hortor, for, meditor, obliviscor, and then metor and adulor. In·
stances from classica] authors are then quoted of the following verbs:
auxilior, adulor, adminiculor, adhortor, auguror, apiscor, abominor, conse·
quor, amplector, complector, adorior, abutor, admiror, testor, antester, exse-
cror, machinor, polliceor, adgredior, aspernor, architector, ads-ector, argu-
mentor, arbitror, blandior, consolor, conspicor, comminiscor, consequor, con·
testor, consector, complector, calumnior, carntficor, dignor, detestor, desperem
demolior, meditor, dominor, clepa-zelor, delargior, ementior, exordior, ex·
perior, frustror, hortor, sor, obliviscor, metor, tutor, vador, venor, velfficor,
voa‘seror, veneror.

It is to be observed that the list in which the words are illustrated by
exampleS, although it purports to be identical with the unillustrated list,
is not entirely 50. The lists with examples is fuller and also more strictly
alphabetical than the other: adulor, for instance, occurs in its place
among verbs beginning with a. The three words reor, vereor, and solor,
which interrupt the alphabetical order in the first list, recur in the second,
but without any instances The impression left on my mind aster read-
ing the two lists is, that the author of the first had copied from the author
of the second, but not quite accurately in respect of the arrangement. In

ἰ other words, that Priscian is making extracts from two manuaIS, both of

which depend on a common source.
