249. ‘ Redire' ‘reducere,’ and other
such words, are coustantly used, as Wund.
remarks, of the recurring order of nature.
‘ Informes hiemes reducit Iuppiter, idem
Summovet,' Hor. Od. 11 x 15.

25ο. ‘ OrienS,' the rising sun, as in A.
v 739, where this line is nearly repeated.
The horses of the sun come panting up
hill, casting their breath, which, as Keight-
ley observes, represents the morning air,
on the objects before them.

251. Seneca (Ep. cxxn 2) quotes this
line with ‘ illis,' which would be highly

lausible, if it had other support. But

irg. is speaking of the region, not os the
inhabitants, and the hypothesis ofvv. 247,
248 would be hardly compatible with the
existence of antipodes at all, though in a
different connexion, v, 237, he seems to
believe in them. So ‘a nobiS,' v. 249,
answers to ‘ illic,’ v. 247.

‘Lumina' is Vesper’s own rays3 not
the sunset, as Voss thinks, taking ‘Ves-

the dld commentators thought, the candles
that are lighted on earth. Comp. lv 401,
‘ medios cum sol accenderit aestus)

⁴ Rubens ’ may merely mean bright,
like ‘luna rubens‚’ Hor. Od. 11 xi 10, or
the colour of sunset may be naturally
transferred to the star.

252-258. ‘ From this disposition of
nature the husbandman and the mariner

252. ‘ Hinc ’ seems to referto the whole
of the preceding passage from v. 231,
which has been devoted to an exposition
of certain parts of the mundane system.
That system has been mentioned at the
outset (‘ Idcirco‚’ ν. 231) as the guar-antee
sor the regularity of the seasonS, on the
knowledge os which the proceedings
of the husbandman depend, and now
Virg. enforces the conclusion—⁶ It is on

the strength of this that we know before-
hand,' etc. Vv. 257, 258 clearly belong
to this paragraph, not to that which
follows (Ramsay, Classical Museum, v
107). They come in fact under ‘ Hinc‚'
which is the introduction to the whole
paragraph. ‘ Hence it is that our watch-

sons are not useless? Not perceiving this
connexion, Ribbeck has placed vv. 257,
258 after 251.

‘ Tempestates ' seems rightl
stood by Keightley os changes 0 weather,
which agrees with ‘dubio caelo.’ Rom.
and fragm. Aug. have ‘ praedicere.'

253. The weather and the seasons are
os equal importance to landsmen and
seamen (vy. 204 foll. z comp. v. 456), so
{jhc occupations os both are mentioned

ere.

‘ Infidum ‘ is significant, as showing the

as Voss thinks, betgeen ‘remiS,’ the
smaller craft, and ‘classis,' the lar er.
But it seems more likely that Virg. st

the cutting down os the timber.

255. ‘ ArmataS‚'rigged. ‘Armariclassem
cursumque parari,' A. 1v 299.

‘ Deducere’ of shi , A. 111 71, lv 398.
Cerda comp. Hor. d. 1 iv 1, ‘ Solvitur
acris hiemps grata vice veris et Favoni,
Trahuntque siccas machinae carinas.’

256. ‘Tempestivam ’ with ‘everteret ¹

Ursinus. Cato xxxl, whom Macrob. Sat. ·

VI 4 rather unreasonably charges Virg.
with copying, sayS, os pines and other
trees, ‘ cum effodies, luna decrescente
eximit0‚ post meridiem, sine vento austro.
Tum erit tempestiva, cum semen suum
maturum erit. Pal. (ΧΠ 15) says that
the best time of the year is February.
