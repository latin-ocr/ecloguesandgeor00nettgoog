P. VERGILI MARON IS

inflavit curn pinguis ebur Tyrrhenus ad aras,
lancibus et pandis fumantia reddimus exta.

sin armenta magis studium vitulosque tueri,

aut setus ovium aut urentis culta capellaS,

dance of expression is common enough in
poetry, e.g. in this passage ‘hic fertilis
uvae, Hic laticis, qualem,’ etc., are only
two ways of saying that the soil bears ood
vines· Early poets are prone to it rom
simplicity‚ later poets from a love os orna·
ment. The feeling which prompts its use
in the particular case must vary with cir-
cumstances; no single rationale, such as
that which supposes the second noun in
the hendiadys to be epexegetical (Bryce
on A. 1 2), will cover the instances. The
relation between the two nouns may be
sometimes described as that of attribute
and subject, sometimes as that os a whole
and its part, etc. But no general rule can
be laid down, except that the two nouus,
while re resenting the same thing, seem
common y to represent distinct aspects of
it, so as not to run into simple tautology.
Hence they may usually be combined in
translation, being reso ved into a noun
with epithet, or a noun with another in
the genitive, as here, ‘golden bowls,’ or
‘ bowls of gold.'

The best wines were naturally those that
were used in libationS. Comp. v. 101
above, Ε. v 71.

193. ‘Pinguis Tyrrhenus? comp. Ca·
tull. xxxix 11, ‘Aut parcus Umber aut
obesus Etruscus-„⁹ [and Ellis‘ note. Etrus·
can sculpturae represent short fat figure5‚
no doubt characteristic os the race. The

proverbial expl. is given by] Serv., ‘ Vic-
timarum scilicet carnibus?

‘ Ebur,' an ivory pipe: com . 1 480,
‘maestum inlacrimat templis e ur,’ and
the use of ‘auro' above. Plin xvl 172
ῗῖιᾲῗῗῗ ιιῗωὲἰὲἓῆῗὲἲέ ἒέἰῗὲθοῑ &1335
Prop. v vi 8 has a sacrificial pipe of ivory‚
though it is Phrygian. Perhaps a pipe
strengthened with ivory rings is meant.
[F lute layers, like actors‚ came to Rome
from truria, or were thought by the
Romans to have done so: see Festus p.
309, Varro L. L. vn 35, on ‘subulo ⁹-
itself robably a Latin word—and Miiller's
EtrusEer (ed. Deecke) ii 202.]

194. ‘ Pandis,’ either curved, deep, or
bowed beneath the weight of the entraiIS.
‘ Pandos autumni pondere ramos,’ Ov. M.

xlv 6603 ‘ rotundas Curvet aper lances'
IIor. Sat. 11 iv 40. On the other hand
‘cavas lances’ occurs in Martial xl xxxi
19. Com . v· 445. Med. a. tn. pr. gives

‘ patulis ' perhaps a gloss, sor Serv. and
the Berne scholia give ‘ patulus’ as an

alternative explanation of ‘ pandus) See
Fest. p. 220 M. ‘ Pandana porta dicta
est Romae, quia semper pateret 3 pandi·
culari dicuntur qui toto corpore oscitan-

{els {xaenduntun eo quod pandi fiunt.'—

‘Fumantia,’ reeking. Serv. however

speaks of the entrails as boiled before
being offered.

⁸ Reddere ’ is said by Serv. to be the
technical word for laying the entrails on
the altar. Stat. Theb. lv 466, ‘ Semi-
neces fibras et adhuc spirantia reddit
Viscera3’ Tac. H. 1v 53, ‘Lustrata suo-
vetaurilibus area et super caespitem red·
ditis extis)

195-202. ‘ For razing choose a country
like the lawns of arentum and the plain
of Mantua’

195. ‘Tueri ε ’ comp. Col. vl 3, ‘tueri
armentum paleis,’ in which and other
p es ‘tueri ' seems to have the mean·
ing o ‘sustentare.' Amore general sense
however is recommended by the parallel
use, 111 305. For ‘studium tueri ’ see
1 21, 213.

⁸ Armenta ’ includes horses ancl oxen.

‘ Vitulos ’ probably has special reference
to the breeding.

196. [‘ Fetus ovium : ’ Pal. has ‘ ovium
fetum,' and so Ribbeck, Con. 3 Nonius and
Med. have ‘ ovium setuS.'—H. N. ‘ Fetus
ovium ' is found only in the later and in-
ferior MSS]

The goat was held, either by its bite, or
by something poisonous in its saliva, to
kill crops and trees, especially vines and
olives. Comp. Varro 1 ii 17 soll.‚ whence
it ap that ‘coloni ’ were sometimes
forbi den in the ternis of their lease to
keep goats ‘in agro surculari0,’ where
vines, oliveS, or other trees were planted.
See also vv. 378 soll.

‘ Urenti5,' causing to wither: comp.
177. ‘Culta'= ‘sata’ ·
