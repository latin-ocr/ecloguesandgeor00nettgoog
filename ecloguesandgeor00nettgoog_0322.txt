P. VERGILI MARONIS

progeniem parvam dulcisque revisere nidos;

haut, equidem cred0, quia sit divinitus illis

415

ingenium aut rerum fato prudentia maior;

verum, ubi tempestas et caeli mobilis umor
mutavere vias et Iuppiter uvidus austris

denset, erant quae rara mod0, et, quae densa, relaxat,

vertuntur species animorum, et pectora motus

420

nunc alios, alios, dum nubila ventus agebat,
concipiunt: hinc ille avium concentus in agris
et laetae pecudes et ovantes gutture corvi.

Si vero solem ad rapidum lunasque sequentis

ordine respicieS, numquam te crastina fallet

425

hora neque insidiis noctis capiere serenae.
luna, revertentes cum primum colligit igniS,

415, 416. An allusion to Pythagoream,
Platonist‚ and Stoic 5 iritualism, which
Virg. here rejects in avour of the Epi-
curean and Lucretian materialism. In lv
219 etc. he mentions the ⁸ anima mundi’
view without disapprobation.

‘ Sit :' here as elsewhere the subj. is
used of a reason not accepted as true by
the speaker z Madv. § 357 b.

‘ Divinitas ’ is dist· uished from ⁸ fat0,'
as Virg. is a parent y alluding to the
la e of di erent philosophies. ‘ Not,
if may jud e, that Heaven has given
them any spat of wit like ours, or F ate
any deeper insight into things! ⁸ Rerum
prudentia ’ go together. ‘ Maior,' ‘ more
huam usual ’—more‚ for instance, than men

ve.

It seems better to follow Reiske in

intin ‘Haut, equidem credo ² than to

eep t e common punctuation ‘ Haut
equidem credo.’ ‘ Equidem credo ’ is
thrown in modestly. ⁴ Iuvat—nidos ' will
then be a kind of parenthesis, giving the
reason for the joy of the birds, which is
the main subject of the sentence. Ov. M.
xv 3 59however has ‘ Haut equidem cred0. ’

417. Lucr. v 1083, ⁸ Et partim mutant
cum tempestatibus una Raucisonos cantus)

418. ‘ Mutavere vias’ is explained by
‘ mobilis,' the weather and the atmospheric
moisture being supposed to shift. ‘ Com-
mutare viam ⁸ occurs Lucr. 11 130. There
is no occasion to follow Ribbeck in read·
ing ‘ vices,' the conjecture of Catrou and
Markland, found also in some late MSS.

‘ Iuppiter uvidus austris ’ denotes the

condition os the atmosphere before the
change. Connect ‘ uvidus austri5‚' not, as
Keightley‚ ‘ austris denset.’ ‘ Umidus
auster‚’ v. 462. Rom. and Gud. have
‘ umidus ’ here.

419. For ‘ denset ' see on v. 248.

420. ‘ SpecieS,' phaseS, a materialistic
word. ⁶ Motus‚' also materialistiC.

421. ‘ Alios, dum nubila ventus agebat '
is to be construed parenthetically. The
change from low to high spirits being the
point, the second ‘ alios ' is logically
‘quam' Comp. ‘Nunquam aliud natura,
aliud sa ientia dicit ² (Juv. XIV 321);
‘alium ecisti me, alius ad te veneram '
(Plaut. Trin. 1 ii 124).

422. For ‘hinc' Med. am. p. has ⁶ hic.'

Perhaps we may render ‘ There lies
the secret of the birds' rural choruS, and
the ecstasy os the cattle, and the rooks’
triumphal paean.’

424-437. ‘ You may get prognostioe too
from observing the sun and moon. Ob-
scurity in a new moon is a sign of rain ε
redness, of wind; if she is clear on her
fourth da , there will be fine weather to
the end o the month.'

424. ⁶ Rapidum : ’ whirling.

‘ Sequentes,‘following each other. ‘ Lu-
nas ’ might mean either the daily or the
monthly moonS‚ but, 1001(ἰηὶ to ⁶ primum ’
and ‘ ortu quart0,' it proba ly means the

, daily.

426. Cerda comp. A. v 851, ‘Caeli
toties deceptus fraude sereni.'
