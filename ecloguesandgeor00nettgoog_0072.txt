lxviii THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

After some further remarks on the confusion of voiceS, in which on p.
391 the beginning of a fresh alphabetical list is quoted from Caper
(adiutor—delapidor)‚ Priscian, on p. 392, starts the subject again with
another long list which is in the main alphabetical: testo, opine, aenda,
convive, contemplo, console, commem, auxilie, auguro, auspice, commento,
crimino, molle, digna, exaro, epula, eiulo, lucta, luctt’to, luxurio, laete,
ludifioe, mei-ereo, These words are given without any instances: and
then follow some more which are illustrated from classica] authors:

, hor to, largio, aucupe, alterco, medica, amplexa, amplecto, complecto, Of

these usageS, Priscian adds, examples may be found in Pliny (that is,
presumably, in the libri dubii sermonis), as well as in Caper and
ProbuS.

After a digression on active words used passively (pp. 393-396),
the alphabetical list interrupted on p. 392 is resumed at the word
munero, and we have a list from m to u (munero—utor), to which
are finally added a few more words (murmure, praesagia, and opino).

Comparing the lists given on pp. 392-393 and 396 with the former
lists (pp. 379-387), it is impossible not to come to the conclusion that
they are derived (the first at second-hand) from two independent works
treating of the same subject. Were the two. lists supplementary to
each other, did each confine itself to words which the other omitted,
it would of course be natural to argue that both came from the
same treatise. But this is not the case. The second list contains
a considerable number of words already included in the first; a sure
sign that Priscian is using two distinct workS‚ each of which had
its own list, though the catalogues to some extent covered the same
ground.

Priscian mentions three writers as his authorities, Pliny, ProbuS, and
Caper: ‘eorum et superiorum omnium usus tam apud Caprum quam
Plinium et Probum invenies '—‘ quorum auctores apud Caprum legant
qui eos scire desiderant) In some way or other, then, we must suppose
that the honour of these lists must be divided between these three writerS,
or rather, between Pliny and ProbuS.

Let us now compare the lists of Priscian with that in the seventh book
of Nonius

A large number of words are common to the lists of Nonius and
Priscian: between sixty and seventy‚ if Ῑ am not wrong, out of a
hundred or rather more. The majority of the instances in Nonius
coincides with the second list in Priscian: the others correspond
mostly with the first, but in some cases with notes in other parts of
Priscian.

This general coincidence would naturally lead us to infer a common
origin for the lists of Nonius and Priscian ; and there are minor indica-
tions which point in the same direction. A few of Nonius’ instances are
to be found in Quintilian τ this is the case with the notes on adsentio, p.
469, punior and fabricor, p. 471, and luxurior, p. 481, forms which are
commented on by Quintilian, lx iii 6. Of some other notes in this part
of NoniuS, we know that they are due·to Caper, that is, in all probability,
to Probus: this is the case with the note on poenitebunt, p. 475 (see
