by the pause in the verse, but by the fact

58. ‘yQuid volui mihi ε’ like the com-
mon phrase ‘ uid tibi vis?' ‘What do
you mean ?’ e suddenly reflects on the
destructiveness of his passion. This is
more natural than to suppose with Heyne
and Voss that he is reproaching himself
for havin} just made a comparison which

sayS, a roverbial expression. The Sci·

spoken of in Aesch. Eum. 938·40 as δεν-

60. ‘Quem fugis' may be for ‘cur me
fugis ? ' (see 1 54), or the meaning may be
‘ you know not whom you avoid in avoid-
ing me,' like ‘ nec qui sim quaeris,’ v· 19.

61. Athens was the only city that
Minerva founded, though in the older
Greek m thology it seems she was a
goddesso fortresses in general, and hence
called ἐρυσίπτολις, ἀλαλκομενηΐς, πολιάς,
πολιοῦχος, etc. Corydon prefers the
country to AthenS‚ the noblest of cities.
We should remember that he is a Greek.

62. ⁶ Ipsa colat,' let her have them to
herself. ‘ Placeant,' ‘let me love the
country,' for ‘ let me enjoy it 3 ⁹—a natural
expression, since the love is essential to
the enjoyment. It occurs again G. 11 485,
‘Rura mihi et rigui placeant in vallibus
amneS, Flumina amem silvasque inglorius)
Gebauer, p. 169, comp. Mosch. v 12, καὶ
