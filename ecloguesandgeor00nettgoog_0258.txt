poetical feeling would lead him joyfully to embrace‚ that he selects
and abridgeS, instead of simply reproducing‚ always with a view
to poetical effect, and that he is far more partial to digressions
and episodes-—points of difference which only remove him still
further than them from those authors who have written with a
practical knowledge. It is certain that he gives few directions
in any part of his subject which may not be found in some
previous writer ; it is, 1 think, no less certain that he occasionally
appears to misapprehend the point of his own precept. The
question is one on which I would desire to speak with all the
humility of a person professing his own ignorance of agricultural
details; but the instances of apparent mistakes which are men—
tioned from time to time in the note3‚ many of them pointed out
by a commentator who professes to speak as a practical man,
Mr. Keightley, seem to show that the supposed reality of the
Georgics is as questionable as that of the Eclogues or the Aeneid.
It is true that Pliny and, still more, Columella quote Virgil with
the respect due to an original authority on matters of agriculture ;
but we may perhaps see a reason for distrusting their judgments
when we consider that both of them have something of the
rhetorician in their own composition, and so may be biassed in
their estimate of an author wh0, as Columella has expressed it‚¹ first
gave Roman agriculture the power of song. That Cicero at least
would have considered the imputation as no reproach is evident
from his language already more than once referred to, where his
object is to vindicate for the orator that power of dealing with
subjects only studied for the occasion which, he tells uS‚ Aratus
and Nicander have successfully asserted for the poet. But what-
ever may have been the extent of Virgil's special familiarity with
agriculture, a criticism which professes to regard the Georgics
simply in their poetical aspect may waive the discussion of Virgil’s
relation to the more practical writers who preceded hiQAdstotle,
TheophrastuS‚ the earlier authors in the Geoponica‚ Cato, and
Varro, and confine its view to those wh0‚ being poets themselve3‚
are likely to have influenced in any way the productiori of a poem
which readers ignorant of the simplest processes of farming may
still study with wonder and delight. Of these the last, and
