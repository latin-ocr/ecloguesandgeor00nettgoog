P. VERGILI MARONIS

atque, ubi iam breviorque dies et mollior aestaS,
quae vigilanda viris? vel cum ruit imbriferum ver,
spicea iam campis cum messis inhorruit, et cum

frumenta in viridi stipula lactentia turgent?

saepe ego, cum flavis messorem induceret arvis
agricola et fragili iam stringeret hordea culm0,
omnia ventorum concurrere proelia vidi,

quae gravidam late segetem ab radicibus imis

sublimem expulsam eruerent; ita turbine nigro

ferret hiemps culmumque levem stipulasque volantis,

corn from the ground, or a thunderstorm
will burst on the field in all its horrors.'

311. ‘Tempestates’ seems fixed by
‘sidera ' to mean ‘ weather' rather than
‘storms.’ The latter notion is not ex·
pressed‚ but left to be inserted. The stars
on which the autumn storms were sup·
posed to de nd were ArcturuS, the Cen-
taur‚ the ‘ds, and the Crown. Cerda
comp. 11. xvl 385, ἤματ’ ὀπωρινῷ ὅτε
λαβρότατον χέει ὓδωρ Ζεύς.

31²· ‘Mollior,' less oppressiva ‘Quas
et mollis hiemps et frigi a temperat aes·
1853 Stat. S. 111 v 83.

313. ‘Vigilate aliquid’ is to bestow
wakesul care on a thing. ‘ vigilataque
proelia dele,'Juv. vu 27 ς ovid, etc.

‘ Ruit imbriferum,' comes down in
showers, Wagn.‚ like ‘nox umida caelo
Praecipitat,' A. 11 8. [For the rhythm
comp. A. 11 250.—H. N.]

314. ‘ Messis inhorruit :’ ὅτε φρίσσουσιν
ἄρουραι, 11. xxm 599. The erect and
bristling a pearance os the field is in-
tended, as orb. remarks, not its agitation
by the wind. For ‘et cum’ Pal. origin·
ally had ‘etiam‚' i.e. a arently ’01181113

315. SerV. says that arro in his books
‘ rerum divinarum ’ speaks of a god Lac·
tans, who made the ears os corn milky.
Serv. read ‘ lactantia ' here.

316. Med. originally had ‘ duceret.

317. The husbandman brings the reaper
with him into the field, and 15 beginning
himself to lop the ears. ‘ Stringeret,' as
1131111( 23¹0 *2⁶³¹* ² ‘¹⁶⁵0‘sp-

318. ‘ Omnia ventorum proelia' sor
‘ proelia omnium ventorum. ⁴ 1 have
seen all the armies of the winds meet
in shock of battle.’ The winds are sup-
posed to be blowing from all quarters
at once, as in A. 1 85 (note), 11 416.

Comp. Daniel vll 2, ‘The four winds
of heaven strove upon the great sea.'
Lucr. v 1230 talks os ‘ ventorum paces ’
(Cerda). Rom. has ‘ consurgere.’

319. ‘ Late ' with ‘eruerent.’
radicibus imis,’ Lucr. 1 352.

320. ‘ Sublimem: ’ the old reading
‘ sublime ' is found in none of Ribbeck's
MSS. but one cursive. Virg. probably
imitated Accius, Medea fr. 1, ⁸ sublime
ventis ex uisum rapi Saxum aut procellis)

‘Expu sam eruerent’ = ‘eruerent et
expellerent‚'as ‘ digesta feratur,' 11 167, =
‘ seratur et digeratur.’ [⁴ Emerent ’ r-
haps ‘ were intending to ' or ‘ were suc as.
tc. -Η, Ν.]

‘ Ita-volantes ’ 1185 greatly puzzled Mar-
tyn and 0111015, who suppose Virg. to com·
pare the hurricane that roots up the corn
(ι gravidam segetem ’) and an ordinary
gust which whirls about stubble (‘cul-
mumque levem stipulasque volantoe'),
‘ita ' being i.q. ‘tam sacili negoti0.' But
the ‘ culmus' and ⁶ stipula’ must be the
straw of the ‘ seges ‘ spoken os in the con·
text3 and the change in the point of view,
by which the same thing is described in
one line as heavy and the next as light, is
natural enough, both representations being
equally true. [Or ‘levem ' and ‘ volantes
might be tertiary predicates.]. It would
seem best then to take ‘ ita’ ⁰ to such an
extent,' ⁸ so furiously‚' compari Lucr.
