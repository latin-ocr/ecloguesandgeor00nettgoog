P. VERGILI MARONIS

Maenalus argutumque nemus pinosque loquentis
semper habet; semper pastorum ille audit amoreS,
Panaque, qui primus calamos non passus inertis
incipe Maenalios mecum, mea tibia, versus, κ 25
Mopso Nysa datur: quid non speremus amantes?
iungentur iam grypes equiS, aevoque sequenti

cum canibus timidi venient ad pocula dammae.
[incipe Maenalios mecum, mea tibia, versus]

Mopse, novas incide faces:

tibi ducitur uxor ; 30

sparge, marite, nuces: tibi deserit Hesperus Oetam.

sionally where there is no pause in the
sense, so that they seem to represent some-

thing in the music. The present line is
from Id. 1 66, etc., ἄρχετε βωιεολικᾶς,
Μοῖσαι φίλαι, ἄρχει) ἀοιδᾶς, where it does
not end but begin the stanzas.

22-25, ‘Arcadia is the country for

pastoral song: Pan and the shepherds

sing there.'
22. He dwells on the thought sug-
gested by the refrain. ‘ tum ² and

‘loquentis' are worded as i to express
the natural music of the whispering trees
(see vu 1), though the reference is really
to the echo os the songs. Compare a
similar double meaning in v 62 (note).
‘ Pinifer Maenalus,’ x 15. [‘ Pinus ’
originally Pal. and Gud.—H. N.]

23. ‘ Amores,' of love-so , x 53.

language‚ as Heyne remarks, resembling
G. 1 124, ‘Nec torpere gravi passus sua
regna veterno.' The reeds were not left
to murmur chance music (comp. Lucr. v
1382 fo‘ll.),. but w,ere disciplined for regular
usifi-Jmppffyuslg nigre-ie} Mopsu3, an ill-
omened and unnatural union ε yes, he has
the honours of a bridegroom.'

26. ‘ Dare,’ give in marriage, A. 1 345.

‘ Quid—amantes?’ ‘what may we not
expect as lovers?’ i.e. what may we not
expect to happen in love ?

27. ‘ Iungentur‚’ of marriage (A. 1 73),
as in similar proverbial expressionS, Aris-
toph. Peace 1076, πρίν κεν λύκος οἶν
ὑμεναιοῖ, Hor. A. Ρ. 13, ‘Serpentes avi-
bus geminentur, tigribus agni. ' This suits
the context better than the interpretation
of later editos, of yoking horses and
griffins in a car, as in 111 91. So the next

verse is intended to express intimate daily
association. For the griffins, lions with
eagles' heads and wings, see Hdt. 111 116.

‘ Iam ’ seems to be distinguished from
‘ aevo sequenti,' the latter marking a later
step in the monstrous revolution.

28. ‘ Timidi dammae,' G. 111 539.
Virg.'s use of the masc. is noted by Serv.
and other grammarian, and perhaps by
Quint. lx iii 6, though he quotes the two
words without the context, and ma refer
to G. 111, l. c. Pal. (originally) an Med.
have ‘ timidae.’ The epithet marks their
ordinary nature, in spite of which they are
to herd with their enemies.

‘Pocula’ is frequently used to si ify
not only a cup but its contentS, G. 1 {rso
that it may easily be used here, where the
notion of a cup is merely metaphorical.
The editors com . G. 111 529, ‘ Pocula
sunt fontes liqui i,’ where the metaphor
almost passes intq a simile—⁸ fontes liquidi
ευξῐςρῖὶιΡὶξοῦἓοιιΙῗ-εηά Conington introduce
this line from Gud. to balance v. 76.]

30. The bridegroom is bidden to pre-
pare for the weddmg by getting the torches
ready himself. ‘ Incide faces is a natural
rustic image, as such things were part of a
countryman’s work, G. 1 292 (note), and
ἑγῖῗιῗῗ ’ἑὲἒὲἃὲζῖ ἓέἑὲῗὶΐὶἓζῖιῧίωέῗὲ
torches. ‘ Tibi ducitur,’ is being brought
home to you.

31. ‘Nuces' were flung by the bride·
groom among the boys ing the
torcheS‚ as the bride approache , Catull.
Lxl 128 foll. The ceremonies are now
supposed to have begun, the signal being
the rising of the evening star: see Catull.
