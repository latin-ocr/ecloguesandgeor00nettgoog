INTRODUCTION. 153

invocation os vBacchus which stands at the head of the Second,
while MemmiuS, allowance being made for the greater diffuseness
in which Lucretius throughout indulges, stands in nearly the same
relation to the one poem as Maecenas to the other. The narra-
tive of the plague of AthenS, with which Lucretius concludes his
poem, was obviously the model of the account of the pestilence
in Northern Italy at the end of Virgil's Third Book. Nor, while
we remark a general similarity in the structure of the paragraphs
in which the strictly didactic portion of the two poems is con·
tained, need we pass over the fact that Virgil is indebted to Lucre-
tius for several of the formul-ae with which he introduces these
divisions os his subject—for the ‘ Principi0,’ for the ‘ Praeterea‚’ for
the ‘Nunc age,' for the ‘Quod superest‚' and for the ‘Contemplator-3

To inquire into the points of dissimilarity between the De
Rerum Natura and the Georgics is virtually to inquire into the
causes which have made the latter uniformly popular, while the
former has been comparatively neglected. The answer is not to
be found in the difference of their subjectS. The materialism of
Lucretius is cold and cheerless enough: but the details of plough·
ing and fallowing, of budding trees and training vineS, of fatten-
ing bulls and curing sick sheep, are not in themselves more
inviting‚ at least to an unprofessional reader. Nor can it be said
that Lucretius fails, where such writers as Aratus and Nicander
fail, from inferiority in poetical power. The invocation to VenuS,
the picture of the old age of the world, the expostulation of nature
with the mortal who repines at his mortality, the portrait of the
seasons and their attendant3‚ and other passages that might be
named, appeal to the imagination perhaps more strongly than
any thing which can be adduced from the Georgica But it is the
artistic part of poetry—that which 1 have attempted to charac-
terize in the Introduction to the Eclogues—which has the most
enduring charm for the generality of readers: and there it is that
Lucretius falls short and Virgil succeeds, Lucretius wrote before
the modulation of the Latin hexameter was thoroughly under·
stood, before the strength and weakness of the Latin language‚
‘ quid possit oriri, quid nequeat‚' had been sufficiently tested.
Even in his finest passages the versification is monotonouS, the
diction cumbrous and diffuse ε his lines follow each other with a
