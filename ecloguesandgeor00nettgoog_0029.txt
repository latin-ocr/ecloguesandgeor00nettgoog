 

LI FE OF VIRGIL. xxv

corded Journey of virgil to Greece is that which he made 13.c. 19, a little
while before his death3 but to this it is impossible that Horace can be
alluding, the ode in question having been written much earlier. May
Horace then be referring to a journey taken by Virgil about the time
when the third Georgic was written Ρ ¹

ς 6. In the year 31 carne the battle of Actium; in 29 Octavianus

returned to Italy from the East. Virgil, who with the assistance of =

Maecenas read the Georgics to him at Atella, seems to have intended at
this time to write an epic poem in celebration of his exploits. The poets
were busy upon the battle of Actium, and Virgil was for the time mught
by the general enthusiasm. But he cannot have entertained the idea for
long. Like Horace, he, for some reason or other, seems to have shrunk
from the direct celebration of the acts of any person t thus in the sixth
Eclogue he refuses to perform this service for Varus. Perhaps he thought,
like Horace, that Varius was the right man to treet such subjects:
Scriberis Vario fortis et hostium Victor, Maeonii carminis· alite: How-
ever this may be, he preferred a wider field, and turned his thoughts to
the Aeneid.

He was engaged for the rest of his life, ten yearS, on this great epic,
which he never lived to finish. Suetonius ² preserves a very important
notice regarding the manner in which the Aeneid was composed, Virgil
drafted it in prose, and then wrote the books in no particular order, but
just as the fancy took him. This fact fully accounts for the numerous
inconsistencies in the narrative as we have it. The narrative of the
wanderings of Aeneas in the third book is not to be reconciled with that
given in the first and fifth 3 the fifth interferes with the course of events
as narrated in the fourth and sixth, and is inconsistent with the sixth in
its account of the death of Palinurus,

There seems no doubt that the third book was written before the
second. For in the second Creusa foretells to Aeneas that he is destined
to come to the land of the Tiber, while in the third he is represented as
acting in entire forgetfulness of this prophecy: a fact easily explained if
we suppose that the second book was written after the third. For the
rest, there are very few notes os time to aid us in determining how Virgil
distributed his work over the ten years he was able to give to it. He
must very soon after ’beginning his labours have read parts of the new

poem to his friends, In a poem written in or about 26 Re. (111 26),
Propertius has the well-known lines—

¹ My friend Mt. T. W. Jackson, of worcester College, has notioed that the third
Georgie seems pervaded by a poet’s enthusiasm for Greece.

latim componere instituit, prout liberet quidque et nihil in ordinem arripiens)
