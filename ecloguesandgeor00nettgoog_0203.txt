ECL. VIII. 95

carmina coepta tuis, atque hanc sine tempora circum
inter victricis hederam tibi serpere laurus.
Frigida vix caelo noctis decesserat umbra,

cum ros in tenera pecori gratissimus herba, ¹5
incumbens tereti Damon sic coepit olivae.

D. Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,
coniugis indigno Nysae deceptus amore
dum queror, et divos, quamquam nil testibus illis

profeci, extrema moriens tamen adloquor hora.

The promise, which is the same as
Horace’s to MaecenaS, Ep. 1 i 1, is rather
premature‚ as it is only m the Ecl es
that any allusion to Pollio occurs. Osshe
editors, however, remark that Nestor
makes the same promise with regard to
Agamemnon in his s ech, 11. 1x 97, and
does not keep it muc better.

12. ‘Coepta' need not imply that he
had taken up the poem and laid it down
again, as Spohn thinks.

‘ Hanc sine,' accept this praise of your
tragedies (‘hederam' as in vn 25 note)
along lwith the military honours of your

lambunt Hederae sequaceS,' Prol v. 5.

14·16. ‘ 1t was just daybreak when
Damon began.’

14. Damon and Alphesiboeus had
‹lriven their flocks afield before daybreak,
as Virg. himself prescribes, G. 111 322
foll„ for the summer months, Nothing
is said of any challenge ς the contest may
have been agreed on before3 or Virg.
may have chosen to pass over the pre-
liminaries altogether, as he has done par·
tially in E. V113 or Damon’s song may
have been answered by Alphesiboeus
without any previous concert. Damon
need not be supposed to be singi of his
own despair, but merely to be pe orming
in character, as Alphesiboeus evidently is;
he takes advantage, however, of the early
lrntznliingzlap if 113ιεί had been bewailing his
os ove m .

‘ cum.'

16. ⁸ Tereti olivae,' not the trunk of an

olive, which would suit neither ‘ incum-
bens ’ nor the epithet ‘teres;’ but his
staff of smoothed olive, which he carried
like Lycidas in Theocr. vn 18, ροικὰν δ’

however, HeinS. and Merkel give ‘ bacu-
lum silvestre sinistrae ').

17-21. ‘Da. Come, entle day, 1 am
mourning the broken aith of my love,
and appealing to the gods as a dying man. ’

17. He sees the day-star rising, and
bids it ‘ Surgebat
Lucifer . . ducebatque diem,' A. 11802.

18. ‘ Indigno amore,’ as in x 10, un·
worthy, because unreturned. Nysa is
‘ coniunx,' because it was as his wife that
Damon loved her. In translating freely
we might talk of ‘ a husband's love.' So

has stood me in no stead hitherto, as Nysa
has broken the vows made before them.
