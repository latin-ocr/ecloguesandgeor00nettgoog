grieves by anticipation, tenderly and gracefully enough, over the
loss which the pastoral world would have sustained had he died
prematurely, of the four fragments of his poeti-y which are
singled out for admiration two are copies from TheocrituS, and
one os them, the first, 5ο close a copy, and so slight, not to say

other view than to remind the reader of his success in borrowing
and skilsully reproducing. It is, in fact, an intimation, made

almost in express κηποι-(15, that he wished to be considered as the
