v. 425 belom] The authority for this punc·
tuation as com red with the other makes
it plausible3 ut it does not seem well
suited to ex ress the sense r uired.
Virg. would ardly say ‘the wil olive
survives in cases where the vines cannot
recover,' as his meaning evidently is that
the vines never recover.

‘ Non a stirpe valent’ is a condensed
expression for ‘ stirpe valent et a stirpe
repullulant 3’ their stock no more shows
lise. ‘ Que ' is disjunctive. ‘ Valent,' sc.
⁴ vites.' ‘Caesae‚' when the burnt stock
has been cut (to make it grow again).

313. ‘Ima terra,' from the earth at
their rootS.

314. ‘ Infelix‚’ barren. ‘ Suxerat’ =
‘ solus superest ι ’ see v. 235. e might
say ‘ is left master of the field!

‘ Foliis amaris ⁹ seems to be an implied
opposition to the ‘ dulces uvae ’ that have
been lost. The bitterness would not
hinder their being good sor fodder 3 comp.
‘ salices carpetis amaras,‘ E. 1 79.

315·345. ‘ Do not plant vines in winter,
but in spring or towards the end of autumn.
In s nng all nature is procreant and
proli c. and the weather favours infant
growth. In spring the world itself was
created. Were there no spring, young
life would perish between the two ex-
tremes of cold and heat.'

315. ‘ Nec,’ etc. = ‘ nec quisquam tam
prudens habeatur ut tibi persuadeat.’ ‘ Let
no adviser have such credit for foresight as
to persuade you.' [For ‘ persuadeat auc·
tor ' Pal. has an extraordinary error, ‘per-
suadit acantho, ²-H. N.]

from planting in winter, when there are
north winds and frost. Com . ι 299.

latter urging that Virg. wouglthnot c{ise

tinguish ‘ tunc ' from ‘tum ' as the more
emphatic, but it does not appear that
there is any such distinction in principle
between the two forms. Here euphony
supports ⁶ tunc.']

‘ Semine iact0,’ a phrase properly re-
lating to the sowi of corn (1 104) or
other seed, is used o the planting of trees.
Comp. vv. 268, 302.

318. ‘ Concretam' m‘ ht be taken as
‘ concretam gelu,’ the epi et which would
naturally belong to ‘terrae' being joined
with ‘radicem But it is better to take
it as = ‘ita ut concrescat‚’ sc. ‘terrae'
Comp. Claudian, 6 Cons. Hon. 77,
‘ Hinc tibi concreta radice tenacius haesit)
[Ribbeck adopts ‘concretum‚’ the first
reading of Med., and takes ‘concretum
terrae ’ together as = ‘the congealed state
of the soil.'—H. N.]

‘Adfigere z ’ ‘id cuius semen est,’ under·
stood from what precede5‚ is the subject, or
perhaps ‘semen itself, the young shoot.

319. ‘Rubenti,’ with flowers. ‘Ante
novis rubeant quam prata coloribus,' tv
306. Col. ιιι 14 says that vines should
be planted in spri or autumn, according
to the climate an the character of the
soil, the time in the former case being
from the middle of Feb. to the vernal
equinox, in the latter from the middle os
Oct. to Dec. 1.
