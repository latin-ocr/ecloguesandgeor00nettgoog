saepe etiam immensum caelo venit agmen aquarum,
et foedam glomerant tempestatem imbribus atris
collectae ex alto nubes; ruit arduus aether,

we made ‘ita’ a particle of transition,
‘ eruerent et sublimem eicerent atque ita,
i.e. erutam, ferrent ;’ but the effect of the
two sentences, thus connected, would be
cumbrous.

322-334. The first part of the following
deseri tion seems modelled on Lucr. vl
253 soll„ the latter t on 11. xvi 384 foll.

322. [The wor s ‘saepe etiam . . .
nubes ' describe the brewing of the storm ε
its descent begins with ‘ ruit. ' ⁶ Agmen '
indicates the march of the rain-clouds
(‘ aquarum ⁹) across the sky: compare
Luer. vl 100 ‘denso agmine nubes!
‘ Caelo ' may be dat. ‘ the clouds come on
to the sky’ (Keightley) or abl. (see v. 5).
Con. was inclined to understand ‘ agmen ’
of the rain descending from heaven, com·
paring Lucr. vt 257 ⁶ picis e caelo demis·
sum flumen,’ but this interpretation makes
v. :323 a case of ὕστερον π , as he
admits. The order of the clauses suggests
the view taken above]

323. So Lucr. l. c. ‘ trahit atram F ul·
minibus gravidam tempestatem atque pro·
cellis,' and ιν 169, ⁸ Tempestas perquam
subito fit turbida foede Undique ’ (which
from another part of the e it is
evident that Virg. had in his mind), Livy
xxv 7, ‘tempestates foedae fuere-³ These
passages show that ‘ tempestatem ' here is
merely weather‚ ‘ foedam ’ having the
sense of ly or grim, [murky.—H. N.]

From tiliis line to 11 139 there is a
lacuna in Pal.

324. ‘ Ex alto' might be taken ‘from
the deep‚' which would doubtless be the
truer view of the henomenon. But it
seems more probable that Virg. meant to
represent clouds as mustered from on
high, ‘ collectae,' like ⁴ glomerant,' keep-
ing u the military associations already
intr uced b ‘ men.’ [Serv. and Gau·
dentius in t e rne scholia take ‘ex
alto ’ as = ‘ex septentrione.'—H. N.]

Comp. v. 443.

‘ Ruit aether: ' ‘aether descendit' 11 325,
‘ caeli ruina'A. 1 129, an image explained
by Lucr. ν1 291, ‘Omnis uti videatur in
imbrem vertier aether. '

325. ‘ Sata laeta boumque labore& A.
11 306, a translation of ἔργα βοῶν, Hes·
Works 46. Homer in the parallel e
has ἔργ’ ἀνθρώπων. Virg., as rsinus
remarks, seems to have imitated Apoll.
R. lv 1282, ribi-110⁸ ὄμβρον 'Anci-ov, ὅστε
βοῶν κατὰ μυρία ἔκλυσεν ἔργα.

326. ‘ Fossae,' v. 372, otherwise called
‘ colliciae ’ or ‘ colliquiae.'

‘Cava z ' ‘During the summer months
in Italy there is little or no water in the
beds ‚of most of the rivers, so that their
channels may justly be called ‘ hollow,'
for they resemble a road running between
two high banks.' Keightley.

327. ‘ Fervet . . . aequor: ' Lu‘cr. νι
427, ‘freta circum Fervescunt graviter
spirantibus incita flabris ;' A. x 291,
‘ vada non spirant,’ the violent
heaving of the waves against the shore
being compared to human breathing.
{The sea glows again through every pant-

328. ‘ Usque adeo taetra nimborum
nocte coorta Inpendent atrae Formidinis
ora superne. Cum commoliri tempestas
fulmina coeptat,' Lucr. vt 253.

‘Ipse‚’ as in A. v 249, ΧΠ 725, etc„
expresses not only dignity (v. 121), but
personal exertion (A. 11 321, etc.).

‘ Corusca ' with ‘ dextra ' = ‘ corus-
cante-⁹ So Sen. Hipp. 156, ‘Vibrans
corusca fulmen Aetnaeum manu,' an imi·
tation which shows how he understood
Vir .

339. ‘ Molitur ι ’ ‘ validam in vitis mo·
lire bipennem,’ lv 331.

‘ Quo motu‚' referring to the sense
rather than the words of the preceding
sentence. So ‘camnine quo,' lv 3483
