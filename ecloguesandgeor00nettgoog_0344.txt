111. The ‘ornus' is mentioned, v. 71,
as one of the trees on which a fruit tree
is engrafted, in conjunction with ⁸ steriles

latani.
p 112. ‘Amantis litora myrtos,’ ιν 1²4·
See on E. v11 62. ‘ Apertos’ suggests
the idea of ‘apricos¹ to which ‘ aquilo·
nem et frigora ’ is opposed. Virg. treats soil
and climate together, as in 1 51 soll.

114. ⁸ Extremis domitum cultoribus
orbem ’= ‘extremas orbis partes cultas.’
‘ Extremis cultoribus ' is dative of the
agent. The sentence is closely connected
with what follows, the sense being, ‘ Look
at foreign lands, go as sar as you will, you
will find each country has its tree.'

115. ‘Pictosque Gelonosz’ Hor. Od.
11 xx 19, ‘ultimi Geloni.' [‘Pictos' =
⁴ stigmata habentes,’ Serv. and the Berne
scholia—H. N.] Claud. in Rufin. ι 313,
LMlembraque qui ferro gaudet pinxisse

‘e onus.

116. ‘ Divisae arboribus patriae ε ’ their
countries are divided among treeS, i.e.
each tree has its allotted country.

‘ Sola India,’ etc. ε 1 57. ‘ Sabaeis ’ in
the next line seems to prevent our taking
⁴ India' as a loose name sor the whole
East, including Aethiopia, and to require
us to take it as India Proper, though
ebony does not grow there alone.

117. ‘Turea virgaz' Pliny (ΧΗ 57),
after stating that there is great doubt as
to the nature of the tree, says ‘ Qui mea
aetate legati ex Arabia venerunt, omnia
incertiora fecerunt, quod iure miremur,
virgis etiam turis ad nos commeantibus:
quibus credi potest, matrem quoque tereti
et enodi fruticare trunco)

119. For the transposition of ‘que ' in

the construction ‘que et‚' comp. Hor.

It is doubt ul whether the baisam and
acanthus are not meant to be distinguished
as belonging to different countrieS, rather
than connected as belonging to the same.
The country of the balsam is by some
thought to be Judaea, by others Arabia
Felix. The acanthus is attributed both to
Egypt and to Arabia ς it is not a herb but
