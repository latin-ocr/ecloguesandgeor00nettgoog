LIB. Ι. 181

nec torpere gravi passus sua regna veterno.

ante Iovem nulli subigebant arva coloni ;

125

ne signare quidem aut partiri limite campum
fas erat: in medium quaerebant, ipsaque tellus
omnia liberiuS, nullo poscente, ferebat.

ille malum virus serpentibus addidit atriS,

praedarique lupos iussit pontumque moveri,

130

mellaque decussit foliis ignemque removit
et passim rivis currentia vina repressit,

ut varias usus meditando extunderet artis

124. This and the last line give the good
side of the changes of the silver age ς labour
was nec for the development of man.
The old m thology, however, ta ht that
man first eteriorated, and that t e need
to labour was intended as his punish·
ment.

125. ‘Subigebant,’ tilledz see 11 50
note.

126. ⁶ Ne’ is the reading of nearly all
MSS. ς one cursive has ‘ nec‚' the reading
of the old editions and originally of Heyne3

bility of ‘ nec . . quidem.’

The sense seems to be: the ground was
free not only from breaki up by the

lough‚ but from division bylffie landmark.
ι he thought will hardly bear to be put
zzfissussz0‘gffiffpzrhgpzief052affl {5¹:33
nected, Virg. would scarcely speak of
the latter as necessarily preceding the
former. Ov- Μ. 1 136 postpones the
division of the land till the brazen age,
cultivation having begun in the silver.
‘ Signare ' may contam a reference to
‘ assignati0.’

127. ‘In medium,’ ιν 157, Α. xl 335
(note), with a view to the common stock.
This refers to, ‘ne signare quidem,’ and
‘ ipsaque tellus ' to ‘ ante Iovem.'

‘ Ipsaque tellus z ' κ πὸν δ’ ἔφερε ζείδωρος
ἄρουρα Ain-optim πο τε καὶ ἄφθονον,
Hes. Works 118. So even Lucr. 11 1159,
‘Ipsa dedit dulcis fetus et abula laeta,
Quae nunc vix nostro gran escunt aucta
labore,’' and v 942.

128. ‘ Liberius ’ seems to include both
{imit ”uibss‘ffmssrfiffieffimfflnssg
et Cereremqferunt,'ugHor. od. 111 agiv
12. Heyne.

129. The extinction of the serpent
and poeification of the wolf signalize
thgoreturn of the golden age. E. 1v 24,
v .

‘ Malum ' maybe used, as Serv. thinks,
because ⁸ virus ' is a neutral word for
animal fluid: but it seems more obvious
to take ‘ virus ' in its ordin sense, ancl
regard ‘ malum ² as a pieceadydescri tive
simplicity, like ⁸ malos fures,’ Hor. “. 1 i
⁷⁷² Ater ’ frequently occurs as an epithet
of serpents‚ when it would not be easy to
say whether it is to be construed in its
primitive sense of black, or its derivative
meaning of deadly. In lv 407, where it
is applied to a figet, it means the latter.

130. ⁴ Moveri, deponent, to swell. To
understand it of saihng would anticipate
v. 136, as Heyne remarks. Forb. comp.
Lucr. v 999 foll„ where the sea is de-
scribed as rising and falling idly so long
as there were no ships for it to threaten.
But the two es are contrasted as
well as parallel ς what is the second stage
with Virg. answers to the normal state
with Lucr. .

131. ‘ Mella: ’ see E. lv 30, note.

‘Ignemque removit τ’ κρύψε δὲ πῦρ,
Hes. Works 50, who oes on to tell how
Prometheus defeated t e purposes of Zeus
by stealing fire.

132. ‘ Flumina iam lactiS‚ iam flumina
nectaris ibant‚’ Ov. M. 1 111. ‘ Passim'
goes with ‘ currentia!

133. ‘ Usus ε ’ see 11 22. It is,virtually
