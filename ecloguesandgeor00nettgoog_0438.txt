P. VERGILI MARONIS

corrupitque lacuS, infecit pabula tabo,

nec via mortis erat simplex; sed ubi ignea venis
omnibus acta sitis miseros adduxerat artuS‚
rursus abundabat fluidus liquor omniaque in se

ossa minutatim morbo conlapsa trahebat.

485

saepe in honore deum medio stans hostia ad aram,
lanea dum nivea circumdatur infula vitta,
inter cunctantis cecidit moribunda ministros

cases is apt to lose itself in over—reflue-

artistic variety.

481. So Lucr. vt 1126, speaking gene-
rally of diseases, ‘ Aut in aquas cadit
aut fruges persidit in ipsas Aut alios
hominum pastus pecudumque cibatus)

The absence os the copula after ‘ infecit ³
is doubtless meant to mark the close con-
nexion of the two parts of the verse. The
falling of the pestilence on the drink and
food os the animals is coupled as a single
event with that which it vated and
partly caused, the death os the animals
themselves. Virg. has imitated a line
which is similarly placed at the opening os
the description in Lucr. (vl 1140), ‘ Vas-

Pal. has ‘corripuitque’

482. In the following lines Virg. ap·
parently describes the disease as going
through two op ite stages, parching
sever succeeded pp? liquefaction. ‘ Nec
viamortis erat simplex' then means gene-
rally that the course os the disease was not
uniform, as Keigbtley takes it, rather
than that there was more than one way,
as a comparison of 11 73 would suggest.

‘Via mortis ’ might mean either the
path by which death ap roaches or that
which leads to death. he parallel pas·
sages (Ov. M. xl 7923 Tibull. 1 iii 503
x 4 ; Prop. 4 vii 2) favour the latter
sense.

[⁴Simplex,’ one, as 11 73, etc. Serv.
quotes from Sallust (Hist.) ‘ ne simplici
quidem morte moriebantur: ’ so Livy xl.
xxiv 8, ‘ 1ιῖ simplici quidem genere mortis
contenti-²

483. ‘ Venis omnibus acta,’ ‘the sever
coursi along every vein.'

⁶ Ad uxerat artus: ' from the shrinking
os the skin in sever: Heyne quotes ‘ ad·
ducta cutis ' from Ov. M. 111 398, Forb.
‘ macies adduxerat artus’ from Ov. Her.
xl 27, and ‘ ossaque nondum Adduxere
cutem ' from Lucan lv 288.

‘ Trahebat : ' ‘in manibus nervi tra-
here,' Lucr. vl 1190. Pal. has ‘ at·
traxerat,’ perhaps from a gloss in Philarg.
‘ contraxerat.'

484. ‘ Rursus’ of a change, as v. 138.
For a similar description comp3 Lucr. vl

fluebat,' and the rhetorical account os
death from the bite osa ‘ seps,' Lucan lx
767 oll.

485. ‘Minutatim’ Lucr. 11 1131, etc.
Here it means literally ‘ piecemeal.‘

486. ‘ In honore deum medio,’ in the
middle os asacrifice. For ‘ honor‚’ sacri-
fice, comp. A. 1 49 ‘aris imponet hono—
rem ς’ 1 6323 1 736 ‘laticum libavit
honorem ;’ 111 406 ⁴ in honore deorum :'

‘Vitta,’ abl. of quality with ‘infulafl
It might beabl. instr. with ‘ circumdatur‚’
though this would be awkward, as suggest·
ing another construction.

488. ‘ Ministros,' the attendants who
had the charge of the victim, as in Lucr.
190, called in Greek ἇοζοι (Aesch. Ag.
231). Rom. has ‘ magistros)

‘ Cunctantis ’ is explained by ‘ ante ’ in
the next line. The same picture is given
