6 BUCOLICA.

while a large proportion os the materials for their amoebean
display is to be found in the same or other parts of Theocritus,
scattered up and down. In the friendly rivalry of Menalcas and
Mopsus the depreciation os AmyntaS, the grief of the wild beasts
sor Daphnis, the epitaph, the apotheosis in most of its circum-
stanceS, the compliments which shepherd pays to shepherd, and
the exchange of presents, are all modelled more or less closely
after the Doric prototype. Corydon and Thyrsis are perhaps
more original ε yet even they owe something to Menalcas and
DaphniS, as well as to one or two other Sicilian shepherds, not
only in the antecedents, but in the contents of their songs ; and
the eminence to which Corydon is lifted by his success is similar,
though inferior, to that attained by DaphniS. The dying
Damon, or rather the lover whom Damon personates, recalls in
the first part of his complaint the dying DaphniS, in the last the
slighted Polyphemus: the enchantress who is represented by
Alphesiboeus is the same who in the second Idyl employs even
more charms to bring back Delphis, though the success which
this time crowns her efforts is new. Moeris and his companion,
like Meliboeus and Tityrus, talk about a subject which, being
part of Virgil’s personal history, could not but be his own : yet'
even they supply us with reminiscences from Sicily, partly in the
things which they say to each other, partly in their quotations
from the poet’s unpublished verses The dying Daphnis re·
appears once more in the dying or despairing Gallus: the
complaint of the lover is indeed his own, but the circumstances
which surround him are copied minutely from that song which
ThyrsiS, the sweet songster from Aetna, sang to the goatherd in
the hot noon under the elm. Even this enumeration must fail to
give any notion os the numberless instances of incidental imita—
tion, sometimes in a single line, sometimes in the mere turn of
an expression, which fill up as it were the broader outlines of
the copy. And yet there can be no doubt that Virgil ranked as
an original poet in his own judgment no less than in that of his
contemporaries, and that on the strength of those very appro-
priations which would stamp a modern author with the charge
of plagiarism. His Thalia, he proudly reminds uS, was the first
who deigned to disport herself in the strains of Syracuse, as that
