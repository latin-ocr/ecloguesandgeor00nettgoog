the mountain or island itself being said to
revel (comp. 111 150, ‘furit mugitibus
aether,’ and φυλλομανεῖν and similar
words in Greek). But the use of a de-
ponent participle passively is common
enough, βωεχευθῆναι a pears to be
similarly used», [and ‘ baec are’ itself does
occur.

488.] ‘Taygeta,’ plural of Ταΰγετον.
The common Latin form is ‘ Taygetus.'
[Pal. has ‘ Taugeta,·‘ which Ribbeck
formerly adopted.—H. N.]

The ref. is to the temple of Bacchus in
the range of TaygetuS, to which only
women were admitted (Paus. 111 20).

‘ Convallibus,’ Med„ Pal.. is the

natural word for the glens of Haemus,
and is now generally accepted. The
older reading ‘ in vallibus' seems to have
arisen from v. 485.
, · 490-540. ‘ 1f the sage is blest, so is the
' countryman. Untempted by ambition,
and removed from its crimes, its vanities,
and its penaltieS, he moves in the round
of yearly labour and plenty, with new
fruits constantly pouring in, and ever and
anon a day of rustic merny-making, fol-
lowing the example of the grand old
times of Italian history and legend.’

490. [Munro on Lucr. 1 78, 111 449,
argues that Virgil here means Lucretius,
and this was Conington’s view in his first
ed. Afterwards he came to think that]
Virg. is here sketching the Epicurean
philosopher, whether master, scholar, or

country, whether poets or not. The ex·
pression ‘ rerum causae,’ while accurately
‹lescribing Lucr.'s philosophy, is not found
in his poem, though Munro points to
Lucr. 111 1072, v 1185 as likely to have
suggested the present line. The words

are copied by Ov. M. xv 68, who couples
them with ‘ primordia mundi.’

491. ‘ Metus :’ Lucr. 111 37, ‘Et
metus ille foras raeceps Acherontis
agendus, Funditus humanam qui vitam
turbat ab imo.'

‘ Inexorabile ’ may refer specially to
the argument at the end of Lucr.'s third
book. Rom. has ‘ ineluctabile,’ probably
a reminiscence of A. vul 334 ‘ Fatum ε ’
death, as nature's fiat.

492. ‘ Subiecit pedibus : ' Lucr. 1 79,
‘ Quare religio pedibus subiecta vicissim
Obteritur.’

‘ Strepitumque Acherontis avari: ' in
Lucr. 111 14-30 the philosopher, looking
down, sees Acheron vanish.

‘ Deos qui novit agrestis ι’ throughout
the Eclogues, particularly in E. v, vt, x,
the count gods are represented as
mixing wit the human dwellers in the
country.

495. ‘ Populi fasces : ’ from Lucr. 111
996. This passage again is somewhat
similar to Lucr. 111 59-86, who is speak-
ing of the civil wars os his own time.

496. ‘ Fratres' is generally referred to
one of the domestic contests for Eastern
throneS, such as that between Phraates
and Tiridates for the throne of Parthia3
Hor. Od. 1 xxvi 3 foll„ which somewhat
resembles this passage. [So H. N., note
ori 505] Lucr. however, l. c., has ex-
pressions (vv. 72, 73. 83-86) which speak
distinctly of the disruption of families in
the civil war. ‘ Civil feuds that make
brothers swerve from brother’s duty.'
