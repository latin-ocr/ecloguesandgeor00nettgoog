should be narrow‚ to exclude heat and
cold- These indeed the bees endeavour
to protect themselves against, by stop ing
up every crevice with wax and pol en ε

35. The bees make their own entrances

given by Col. lx 7, are the exclusion, first,
of the eold, and secondly, of lizards and
the larger insects. As a protection against
the extremes of the weather he also lays
stress on what Virg. notices afterwards, the
plasten-ing of the hives‚ and on their being
made of a proper material, eork bei the
best, earthenware the worst. Keig tley
thinks that Virg. here misunderstood his
authorities, and that Col. would not have
mentionedtheweatherasareason fornarrow
entrances, but for his deserence to the poet.

36. ‘ Remittit ’ gives the opposite image
to ‘ cogit.’ Ameis remarks that ‘lique-
facta remittit ’ has the force of ‘ relique·
facit,' a word which is not found.

37. ‘Utraque vis' = ‘utriusque vis.’

‘Apibus metuenda: ’ see 11 419.

sult‚' asv. 45 ows- ‘ Thebeestake good
care of themselven but you should care
for them nevertheless.’ From this line
to v. 181 Rom. is wanting.

38·4ο. [For lining the inside os the hive,

tioned by irgil, bees use propolis or bee-
glue, a brown glutinous resin
(according to modern observers) {rom
poplar buds. The ancients knew this sub·
stanoe, thou h not its precise origin. See
Aristotle (Ι-ῗ. Α. lx 40), οἰκοδομοῦσι τὸ
κηρία verat τῶν τε &Qu-w ἀνθέων καὶ
ἀπὸ τῶν δένδρων τὰ δάκρυα ἰτέας καὶ

ris iam materiae, additis oribu5‚ nondum
tamen cera sed favorum stabilimentum,

means this hee-glue here and vv. 160, 250.
In v. 38 ‘cera' may refer to the fact
(mentioned by Pliny l. c.) that bees
sometimes mix propolis and wax. In
v. 39 ‘ floribus ’ may be due to a miscon·
ception. Bees collect the pollen of floweoe,
{32:2⁵3 -itbffiiZ :133ss?ss 3253&ss
have thought that it was collected to form

t of the hee-glue, of which the did not
now the exact nature. Hence ere and
in some other passages propolis is de·
scribed as isin part derived from flowers.
Keightley and Con. took ‘ fuco et flori·
bus to mean only pollen, but this is
unlikely. Philarg. identified it with pro·
polis ς the Berne scholia add that ‘ fucus ’
refers to the dark colour of propolis]

39. ‘Spitamenta‚' 1 90, here of the
crevices (⁴ rimosa cubilia,’ v. 45), not [as
Serv.] the entrances.

‘Oras ’ isex lained by Keightley of the
entrance& ⁸ 0 points
rather to crevices, as Taubm. understands
it, though no instance is given of ‘orae'
in this sense. It may menn however, as
Mr. ’Blackburn thinks, the edges os the
