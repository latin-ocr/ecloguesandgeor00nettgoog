LIFE OF VIRGIL. xxiii

probably in 37 ως. οι· thereabouts,² were intended, says Suetonius, as a
thank—offering to Gallus, Pollio, and Varus. The first is, of course,
intended as a compliment to Octavianus ; but of the remaining nine,
two (the fourth and eighth) are dedicated to Pollio, two (the sixth and
ninth) to Varus», and one (the tenth) to Gallus, who is also mentioned in
terms of the greatest affection in the sixth.

The acquaintance of Horace with Virgil must have begun before the
publication of the EclogueS. It was either in the year 40 or 38 or 37
(the year when the last Eclogue was probably composed), that virgil,
with Varius and Tucca, the future editors of his Aeneid, joined Horace
at Sinuessa on a journey to Brundisium.² Horace speaks of Virgil as
at that time one of his most intimate friends, as if their acquaintance
were now of long standing. The only relic, as far as 1 am aware, of
the early period of this friendship is the twelfth ode of Horace's fourth
book, which, in spite of the fact that this book was published after
Virgil's death, it seems reasonable to refer to him. The ode, which
Horace perhaps had not cared to publish before, is addressed to a
Vergllius whom Horace asks to dinner on condition of his bringing
with him a box of nard in exchange for Horace’s wine. The language
of the poem would very well suit the time when both poets were young
and Horace poor, and before his introduction by Virgil, the iuvenum
nobilium cliens, to the circle of MaecenaS.

Horace's judgment of the Ecloguae ³ is well known: ‘ molle atque
facetum (epos) Vergilio adnuerunt gaudentes rure Camenaess the
Muses have granted him tendernoes and refined wit in his hexameter
writing. ΤΙιε literary sympathy and intimate friendship between
Horace and Virgil was of immense importance as affecting the history
of Roman literature. It was they who, while enjoining a closer study
of the Greek masterpieoes in their length and breadth than had hitherto
been given to them, formed the classioel style of Roman poetry‚ and
showed how close imitation of great models was compatible with a free
and noble manner, untainted by pedantry or servility. Ι have en-
deavoured elsewhere ⁴ to collect some of the passages which resemble each
other in the earlier works of these twin poets, thus attesting (in all
probability) a constant and intimate communication between them.

The EclogueS, says Suetonius,⁵ were so popular that they were often
