VIRGIL AND HIS ANCIENT CRITICS. liii

But the suspicion becomes something stronger when we find that some
of the notes are traceable to Verrius Flaccus (daedalus, cauturus, petulcus,
auritus, and perhaps reboo), that others are common to Macrobius ancl
NoniuS‚ and others again to those two writerS, with Servius ‘and other
later commentators. For I have endeavoured to show further on
(p. lxiv foll.) that the Virgilian notes which are common to Nonius and
the later commentators cannot be assigned to a later date than the age
of TraJan. And the conclusion to which we are led in the case os the
scholia, whose origin we can directly or indirectly trace‚ it is natural to
extend to those of whose sources we are ignorant.

NOTE·

It was not until after these sheets had been sent to press that 1 was able to pro·
cure two pamphletS‚ Drs, Linke and Wissowa, De Macrobii Saturnaliorum fontibuS,
Breslau, 1880. Dr. inl-te, who goes much more fully than Dr. Wissowa into the
question os the sources os the Virgilian criticisms in MacrobiuS‚ has come to the con-
clusion (1) that the additional notes in Daniel’s Servius are ancient interpolations:
(2) that the Servius os our commentary stands in no relation of dependence to the
Servius os the Saturnalia3 (3) that the ancient interpolators os Servius borrowed, in a
¹5¹1thsssffi{zffffgnffilzmffiz‘ffl3 (¹3⁸3 ᾆῖἑ ἃὲἑῖοἷῖἓέἳᾞῖῗῗῗῖἒ ’ἷὲἷὲἱὲ
from two different manuaIS, of uncertain date, each of which probably contained
information borrowed ultimately from Verrius Flaccus.

With regard to (1) and (3) 1 would observe that the additional notes in Daniel’s
Servius may be interpolations‚ but that whether they are so or not, they are, in my
o inion, taken not from MacrobiuS, but from a continuous commentary. For (1) they
o ten extend without a break over continuous lines ; (2) they sometimes give informa·
tion which is not found in Macrobius; (3) they sometimeS, in a very strikin way,
ignore what is to be found in him, as notably in the case of his sixth boo (see
p. xlv-l). Ι entirely agree with Dr. Linke as to the relation between our Servius
and the Servius of the Saturnalia ς with regard to Macrobius 111 1·12 I 'am not con-
vinced that he is right, as chapters ιο, 1 1 and 12 may come from the Aeneidomastix.
