prefixed to the commentaries of Aelius and Tiberius Donatus. This
memoir, which was formerly attributed to Ti. Donatus, is now by the
almost universal consent of scholars assigned to Suetonius.¹ There is
also a Life prefixed to the commentary which bears the name of ProbuS,
which may also be ultimately based upon Suetonius, but whose author,

whoever he was and whatever authorities he followed, cannot be

acquitted of either ignorance or oeselessness.² And a short memoir is

also prefixed to the commentary of ServiuS, which, although it is for the
most part merely a confused abridgment of the work of SuetoniuS,
contains some additional matter, notably the statement that the lines
about Helen in the second Aeneid (vv. 566 soll.) were Virgil's own,
and were struck out of his manuscript by Varius and Tucca.

The memoir by Suetonius, in the form in which we now possess it,
does not perhaps contain all that Suetonius wrote about Virgil, but so
far as it extends its value is all-important. For SuetoniuS‚ a diligent
and conscientious collector of facts, had access to documents contem-
poraneous with the poet himself,³ including his correspondence with

(Ancient Lives of Vergil, Clarendon PresS, 1879). 1 should have added to those
already adduced the fact that Jerome, in his additions to the Eusebian chronicle,
which in this part are universally acknowledged to come from SuetoniuS, uses lang-uage
about Virgil identieal with that of the Life attributed to Donatus—A. Abr. 1948,
1960, 1965, 2003 = Vita Vergilii 2, 7, 33, 36. [See also J. W. Beck in Fleckeisen’s
Jahrb. cxxxiii 502]

² He puts the confiscation of Virgil’s estate immediately after the bellum Mutinense
(43 Β.ο.), instead of after the battle of Philippi. [See also the criticisms of Thilo in
fleckeisen's Jahrb. cxlix 290.]

auctor est Varius) Gellius, xvn 10, ‘ amici familiaresque Vergilii in iis quae de
ingenio moribusque eius memoriae tradiderunt.’ Tacitus, Dial. 13, ⁸ testes Augusti

correspondence between Augustus and Virgil.
