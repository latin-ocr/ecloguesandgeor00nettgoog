P. VERGI'LI. MARONIS

M. Nunquam hodie effugie83 veniam, quocumque vocaris,
audiat haec tantum—vel qui venit, ecce, Palaemon. 50
efficiam posthac‘ ne quemquam voce lacessas,

D.

Quin age, si quid habeS, in me mora non erit ulla,

nec quemquam fugio: tantum, vicine Palaemon,
sensibus haec imis, res est non parva, reponas,

P. Dicite, quandoquidem in molli consedimus herba. 55
et nunc omnis ager, nunc omnis parturit arbos;
nunc frondent silvae; nunc formonsissimus annus,
incipe, Damoeta; tu deinde sequere, Menalca.
alternis dicetis3 amant alterna Camenae.

D. Ab Iove principium, Musae; Iovis omnia plena ;

49. Damoetas had spoken as if Me-
nalcas wished to get off. Menalcas retorts,
‘ 1 will stake a heifer, if you will have it
s0, rather than you should et off the
wager.’ Macrob. vr ἰ 'says t t ‘ num-
ἳῖῗιῗιωεῖιῖιάῐὲιε ῑιὲἕιίιξιεῗιιςίιέε, ggii? 12?sssz
mortare.’

‘Numquam hodie’ recurs A. 11 67q
‘ Numquam omnes hodie moriemur inulti,'
and is found in the comic writers (Plaut.
Asin. 111 iii 40, Ter. Phorm. v iii 22,
Adelph. 1v ii 31), as an arch way of saying
that a thing shall not be; ‘ hodie ' seems
to be a comic pleonasm, [and ‘ nunquam ’
a strengthened ⁶ non,' as Donatus on Ter.
Andr. 11 iii 10 says]. Gebauer, p. 31,
comp. the use of οὔποτε in Theocr. V111 10,
15, where we should more naturally say,
· by no means.’

5ο. ‘ Vel ’ goes rather with ‘qui venit ’
than ‘ Palaemon.’ Compare Theocr. v 50
fou„ where Lacon wishes for a particular
judge‚ but Cometes says that a woodcutter
close by will do, Here Menalcas begins
as if he wished for some one in particular,
but corrects himself, and offers to take the
chance of a man just then approaching,
whom he identifies at the end of the verse
as Palaemon: ‘ The man who is coming
up—therel Palaemon it is.' Palaemon
the grammarian, as Suetonius tells us (Ill.
Gramm. 23), used to quote this line as
showing that he was destined to be a
critic before his birth : an opponent might
have retorted that he is mentioned merely
as ὁ τυχών.

51. ‘ Posthac ’ with ‘lacessas’ ⁶ Voce
lacessas,' challenge in singing, i.e. chal·
lenge to sing.

52. Damoetas, as the original chal·

60

lenger, had the right of beginning (Theoer.
vl 5, πρᾶγος δ’ ἄρξατο Aci νις, ἐπεὶ καὶ
ἷξῗίἳὲιίἵὲῗὲἔ)ᾏὲιξίἓξιὴῇἳωῖῗιὲῗᾙνξέ

‘ Si quid habes,’ εἴ τι λέγεις, Theocr. t·
78, is apparently contemptuous, though a
reference to v 10 (see note), 1x 32, will
show that it is not necessarily s0.

‘ In me mora non erit ulla ’ is a phrase,
as in Ov. M. xl 160, ‘in iudice, dixit, Nulla
mora est.’ ‘ Per ' is also used ; as in Ter.
And. 111 iv 14, Juv. x11 111.

53. ‘ Nec quemquam fugio,’ 1 am con·
tent with any judge. ⁴ Vicine : ' Damoetas
tries to conciliate Palaemon, while asking
of him a simple act of justice.

54. ‘ Res est non parva' seems better
referred to the importance of the contest
than to the magnitude of the wager.

55. ‘ Since we are seated on the soft
grass, and all around us invites to son .'
In Theocr. v 45 foll. the rivalry of t e
shepherds extends even to the choice of a
place for singing, each praising his own.

56. Comp. G. 11 323, 330. Emmen.
refers to Bion,vl 17, εἴαρι πάντα κύει, πάντ’
εἴαρος dada βλαστεῖ.

57. ‘Now the year is at its sairest.’
[‘ Formonsissimus the best MSS. : see
1 .—H. N.]

558. Juv. lv 34, ‘ Incipe, Calliope, licet
et considere,' is perhaps an allusion to
this line and v. 55.
