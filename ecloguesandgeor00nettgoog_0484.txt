It should be noticed that in all these
passages ‘ satur ’ is used of a purple or
crimson colour. Hence perhaps the fact
that the Berne scholia give two ex lana-
tions of it here, ‘rubeo' and ‘Esqp’
abundanti.' Probably the last is rig t.

Such enumerations, as Heyne sayS, are
poets and in

common in the old Greek
their imitators, especially Ovid. In the
former they mark the simplicity of the
ehronieler: in the latter they are doubt·
less designed to produce an appearance of
verisimilitude, at the same time that
Heyne may be ⁶ ht in speaking of them
as an intentional isplay of learnmg, while
the imagination is naturally captivated by

the mere sound of a long succession of
harmonious names belonging to mythic
&qui-ty, as any reader of Milton can

mon solution os the construction is that the
acc. denotes the extent to which the sub-
ject of the verb or participle is affected, but
this cannot be a lied without harshne-

double sense of ‘ traicio,' which takes an

however, is not impeached a few ex·

seems no call to follow Madvig, ὅ 237 b,

‘the participleperf. of the passive . . .

mitted to be an exception. In such cases,
however, it is hanrdous to dogmatiae.
[Perhaps, aster all, the simplest explana·
tion of this construction may be obtained
by supposing that the acc. is simply the
