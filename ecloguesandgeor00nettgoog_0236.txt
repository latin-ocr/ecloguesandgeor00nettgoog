be constructed to prove that Calpurnius wrote only seven Eclogues,
because, according to ServiuS, only seven of Virgil's are rustic proper.
Wernsdorf had passed lightly over an apparent objection to his theory
founded on the similarity of passages in the earlier Eclogues to passages
in the later, alleging other instances in which poets repeat themselves:
Haupt contends that this apology does not touch the oese of the third
and ninth EclogueS‚ the latter of which is an obvious though unskilful
imitation of the former. Having thuS, as he conceives, shown that the
poems in question cannot be by Calpurnius, he endeavours to prove
that they are rightly attributed to NemesianuS‚ pointing out some
resemblances between them and Nemesianus' Cynegetica, and urging
that the silence of Vopiscus is not of that kind which would establish a
negative. He shows that the MS. evidence for divided authorship,
instead of testing on a single copy, is really supported by two otherS,
one of thern the best of all, the Neapolitan, and by the tradition of a
third3 while he considers the inscription of Calpurnius' Eclogues to
Nemesianus to have arisen from a confusion between the concluding
‘ Explicit Calpurnii bucolicon ’ and the opening ‘ Aurelii Nemesiani
Carthaginiensis bucolicon incipit,’ which would follow it immediately,
and cites other instances of similar amalgamations by transcribet-s.
Lastly, he separates the two poetS, who had been previously supposed
to be contemporarieS, by a gulf of more than two centurieS, leaving
Nemesianus at the date to which he is commonly fixed by external
evidence, the date of the emperor Carus and his sonS, and advancing
CalpurniuS, whose ordinary date rests partly on the inscription to
Nemesianus mentioned above, partly on an arbitrary identification of
him with a certain Junius Calpumius‚ named by Vopiscus as the
emperor’s ‘ magister memoriae,' to the tirne of Ner0, to whose reign
he points out several allusions in the Eclogues. Without presuming to
affirm or deny the validity of this chain ¹ of reasoning, Ι may perhaps be
allowed so far to adopt Haupt’s position as to speak of Nemesianus as
the author of four out of the eleven pastorals.

Calpurnius' first Eclogue is a sort of imitation of the Pollio, intro·
duced by a dialogue between two shepherds, brothers, Ornitus and

¹ Mr. Merivale (Hist., vol. vii p. 41) contends that the allusion to the emperor
at the end of the seventh Eclogue ‘ points much better to Domitian.’ On the other
hand, Mr. Greswell believes the emperor in question to be the youngest Gordian,
[and so Garnett, Journal of Philology xvi 217. But the conclusions of Haupt as to
date and authorship are now generally accepted: that is, Calpurnius wrote seven
Eclogues in the earlier part of Nero’s reign. His poems have been edited (with
numerous conjectures) by Bahrens (Poetae Lat. Min.) and Schenkl (Leipzig, 1885)
and translated into English by E. Scott (London, ¹891).]
