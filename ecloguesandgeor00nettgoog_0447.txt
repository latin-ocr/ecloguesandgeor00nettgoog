‘ Aerii melliS,' referring to the supposed
origin os honey from dew (E. lv 30 note),
μέλι δὲ τὸ πῖπτον ἐκ τοῦ ἀέρος, καὶ μάλιστα
τῶν ἄστρων ἀνατολαῖς, καὶ ὅταν κατασκήψῃ
ἡ ἶρις, Aristot. H. A. v 223 so Pliny XI
30. Compare Sen. Ep. 85, ‘ quibusdam
placet non faciendi mellis apibus scientiam
esse, sed colligendi. Hinc mel aerium
Vergili0, quod ex rore aeris factum: Pro·
tinus—dona.' [Philarg. quotes a state·
ment of Celsus that bees made their wax
from flowers (see v. 40 below), and their
hon from dew.—H. N.]

‘ aelestia ' is to be understood partly
in the sense of ‘ aerii,' partly as an acknow-
ledgment that the ‘ft is from the gods.

2. ‘ Exsequi‘ is equentlyused of going
through a subject, as in Livy xxvn 27,
‘ si quae variant auctores omnia exsequi
velim ε ’ Tac. A. 111 65, ‘exsequi senten·
tias haud institui, nisi insignes?

‘ Aspice ’ in the sense of regarding with
favour. ‘ Aspice et haec,' Pers.. 1 125.

3. ‘ Admiranda' is an epithet os ‘ spec·
tacula.' A contrast is intended between
‘ admiranda spectacula ' and ‘levium
rerum,' and the two following lines are
2fz²÷02⁶;³ff.20.;z.3‚2233¹32”5.2d¹321233

ν “ t
the ffios a whole nation‚ its character, its
sss ...mm aasz? ‹gsssi’st

4. The force of ‘magnanimos ' ns ex-
pressed by a whole line lower down, v. 83,

Ingentis animos angusto in pectore ver-
sant.' ‘ Ordine ’ is constructed with
‘ dicam,’ but its position after ⁸ totius ' is
significant, impl ⁸ that the whole is to
be regularly divid into its parts.

5. ‘ Mores ’ [natural character, ‘ studia,'
pursuits, i.e., the natural endowments and
acquired faculties. The two words ‘are
3553203. 5³⁰222f¹⁶1ffi ,ggffiuffigfflg
used of horsea]

‘ Populos? [civie communities (H. Ν.)

Conington rendered ‘ clans.' ‘ Gens,’ of
course, includes ‘ populi' (whatever its
sense)‚· as in A. x ²⁰²⁹, where several
Ρέρῳίη ‘gleanligfffi' tlaeffiinlg on which the
labour is spent, as ‘laborare in re ' isoften
used. In Tac. A. lv 32 ‘nobis in arto et
inglorius labor,’ the image is taken from
Εκῗιξέιῗιξειῖἓηωέἰξῃτίῑάεξρῗὲἰ glory os a
t whom the gods inspire is not to
measured by the littleness of his theme.
He does not advert, as in 111 289 foll„ to
the slightness os the subject as euhan-
giing the triumph of the man who could
orn it.

7. ‘ Numina laeva sinunt,' ‘ whose evil
star leaves him free.’ ‘ Laeva' was inter-
preted by Gell. v 12 to mean ‘adverse t ’
[Nonius on the other hand (pp. 51, 331), ·
Philarg., Serv„ and the Berne scholia]
explain it to mean ‘ propitious) The
word itself could bear either sense, for in
Roman a the left was favourable
(Pliny N. ἓ. 11 142, Festus 339, 351)
while in Greek augury it was unsavour·
able (Cic. de Div. 11 82). In Virg. it has
a good sense in the phrase ‘intonuit ·
laevum ’ (A. 11 693, lx 631), a bad sense in
A. x275‘ Sirius. . . laevo contristat lumine
caelum ἐ in E. 1 16 and A. 11 54 ‘mens
laeva ’ ε·- foolish. [similarly ‘ sinister '
has both senses ι ‘dexter,’ on the other
hand, always means ‘ propitiouS.'] The
use os ‘ sinunt ' suggests that ‘laeva ’ here
means unpropitious: it implies that per·
mission is not a matter os course.

‘ Auditque vocatus’: com are Hor. Od.
11 xviii 40, 111 xxii 3, an A. 111 395,
‘ aderitque vocatus Apollo)

8-17. ⁸ First, the situation sor a hive.
It should be out of the way of wind,
of cattle, which spoil flowers and grasS, of
lizardS, swallowS, and other birds, which
injure the garden and devour the insects.’

9-12. Quoted and adopted by Col. lx 4.
