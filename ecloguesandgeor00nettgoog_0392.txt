284 ⁰ P. VERGILI MARONIS

MS. of Virg. and the MSS. of Priscian in three places having a curious variety,
‘volat:' in A. x 785 ‘transit' from no authority, except that Med. originally had
‘ transiet :' in A. x 817 ‘transit ³ from Rom. , two of Ribbeck’s cursives (⁸ c ’ and ‘ m ²)
and some other copies having ‘ transilit.' Thus the only passage where there is any
preponderance of authority for the form of ⁸ it ² is A. tx 418, and there the only extant
uncials are Med., Pal. and Rom. , the two former of which may pair off with each other:
in the other passages the weight, so far as it falls anywhere, falls almost wholly on Rom.
Rom„ it should be mentioned, is wanting in the two first cited passages, that before us
(G. 11 81) and A. 11 497, in both of which it may probably have read ‘exit,' though
A. x 785 shows that the inserence is not absolutely certain. But the fact is that Rom.
almost invariably turns the perfect ‘ iit ' into ‘ it‚’ not merely in compounds of ‘ eo ‘ but
in other verbs. Not only is ‘audiit ’in Rom. constantly written ‘audit,’ but in the
two passages in Virg. where it occupies the fifth place in the verse, A. v 239, vu 516,
the dactyl is made out by reading ‘ audit et.' In other passages ‘it ’ is introduced in
that MS. in disregard of mette, as in A. vm 363, ‘ subit,’ A. x 67, ‘ petit,’ unless we ‚
suppose the scribe to have intended the words either to be pronounced ‘subyit,’ ‘ petyit‚’
or to be read as trisyllables‚ the second ‘ i' being omitted in writing, as it is in the best
MSS. in such words as ‘ obicit.’ ‘ subicit.' The case is the same with the double ‘i '
in the perfect infinitive, which Rom. almost always writes single. The same phaeno-
mena are occasionally observable in Med., Pal., and other MSS. cited in Ribbeck's
apparatus criticus, but to a far less extent. On the other hand, instances are found
where a transcriber has written the double ⁴ i ’ for the single contrary to the metre. On
the whole it seems that considerable confusion on the subject prevailed among the
copyists, not only of Virg., but (as in the instances cited from Nonius) of other authors,
but that there is no evidence that this confusion was due to any notion about the
quantity of the final syllable of the perfect indicative of ‘ eo ' and its compounds. The
existence of ‘ ambiit’ A. x 243 (which even Rom. does not alter) is an argument for
supposing that Virg. did not recognize Lachmann's rule, for, though ‘ ambio ’ is not
conjugated throughout like ‘ exeo’ or ‘ transe0‚’ they·must be at bottom the same, and
‘ exiet,' ‘ transiet‚’ following the analogy of ‘ ambiet‚' are not absolutely unknown even
to classical latinity. NVagner argues against Lachmann’s doctrine in his Lect. Verg.
pp. 316 soll„ though his main reason, the inadmissibility of the rhythm produced by
‘ transit’ in A. v 274, savours rather of the arbitrariness of the precept which he con·
troverts ε and 1 am glad to find that Mr. Munro (on Lucr. 111 1042) is not dismayed by
his great predecessor's dictum ‘ adeo grammatici nostri ea quae quivis puer Romanus
sciebat neglegunt, nos autem senes ea operose quaerere cogimur quae nobis magistri
nostri olim tradere debebant.’

[It is probable that in the earliest Latin the ⁸ -it ' of the third person singular perfect
indicative active was long in all verbs. In Plautus it is usually, if not invariably, long
(see e.g. Miles 213, Pseud. 311, Rudens 199) and early inscriptions sometimes spell
‘ ·eit,’—though it must be admitted that ‘ ei ’ is sometimes short on such inscriptions and
that the exx. of ‘ ·eit ' are not very numerous. Traces of this original length exist in
classical poetry perhaps in a few exx. like ⁴ enituit ’ above (11 21 1), but chiefly in ‘ iit,’ its
compounds, and ⁸ petiit) all of which are seldom used with the last syllable short, and
are in Ovid, though not elsewhere, regularly long.]
