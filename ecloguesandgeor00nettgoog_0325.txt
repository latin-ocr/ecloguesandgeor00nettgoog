points to the latter of the two interpreta-
tions suggested, ‘ hoc ’ being σήμασι τούτοις.
But it is possible that Virg. may refer to
what follow5‚ and that ‘nam ' v. 451 has
the force os ‘ nempe ' (see 11 398), explain·

456. ⁸ F ervere ε ’ Virg. also uses ‘ef-
fervo,’ ‘strido,' and ‘fulgo.’ ‘ Non ’ is
for ‘ ne’ ς see 111 140, A. ΧΠ 78 note.

457. Ribbeck reads ‘ moveat ’ from
Med. a m. p.‚ it is difficult to see why.

‘ Convellere funem,’ cast loose the rope
fastening the ship to the shore.

458. Atat. 126 foll. Aratus says that
if the sun sets without cloud but there are
red clouds above, then there is no danger
of rain next morning or at night. Virg.
omits half the prognostic, and extends the
rest to the morning.

459. ‘ Frustra terrebere nimbis ’ appears
at first sight to mean ‘ ou need not be
frightened by clouds, i there are any,’
implying that there are likely to be some.
But the words seem to be a rhetorical

translation of Arat. 1. c. οὔ σε μάλα χρὴ
Αὔριον οὐδ’ ἐπὶ νυκτὶ mma-popam ὑετοῖο.

460. ‘ Claro ' marks that the fear of
‘ nimbi ' is vain.

when he darkened himself in grief for the
death of Caesar, though in truth that was .

to a second battle of Roman against
Roman, fought in the same countryas the
first, and leaving relies to be turned up
in distant days by the husbandman.'

‘ Unde serenas Ventus agat nubes '
seems to be explained by the previous
line. The sun gives prognostics of sair
winds producing fair weather. ‘ Serenas
agat nubes’ is either ‘agat nubes ita ut
serenum sit eaelum‚' or, as Mt. Blackbum
thinks, brings clouds prognosticating fine
weather. [Nonius p. 175 in a note on
‘ seresco ’ says that Virg. here is using
‘ serenas ’ ‘ docte ’ in the sense os ⁸ siccas»,
and quotes ‘arida nubila ’ from G. 111 197.
This note occurs in a shorter form in the
Berne scholia. There seems no reason
