reddemus Nymphis, et cum lustrabimus agros.

P. VERGILI MARONIS

75

dum iuga montis aper, fluvios dum piscis amabit,
dumque thymo pascentur apes durni rore cicadae,
semper honos nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt.
ut Baccho Cererique‚' tibi sic vota quodannis

agricolae facient; damnabis tu quoque votis,
. Quae tibi, quae tali reddam pro carmine dona?

80

nam neque me tantum venientis sibilus austri,
nec percussa iuvant fluctu tam litora, nec quae
saxosas inter decurrunt flumina valles,

Me.

Hac te nos fragili donabimus ante cicuta.

7 76. An appeal to the uniformity of
nature, as in 1 59, not altogether con-
sistent with the language in which (v. 60,
note) he makesa breach of this uniformity
a mark of the golden age just beginning.

79. Bacchus and Ceres are mentioned
as the chief patrous of the husbandman.

81-84. ‘ Mo. How am 1 to reward you
for a song which is sweeter than anything
in nature? ’

82. ‘ Sibilus austri’ is the ψιθὺρισμα of
Theocr. 1 1, the breeze getting up (‘ veni-
entis ⁹) and rustling through the branches.

Lucr. v 1382 has ‘Zephyri sibila' in a
passage which Virg. may have thought of,
as it ascribes the origin of the pastoral
piffi to the winds whistling through the
re s,

83, 84. Theocr. 1 7, 8, ”Αὸιον, ὦ ποιμὴν,
τὸ τεὸν μέλος, ἣ τὸ κατα ἐς Τῆν’ ἀπὸ τᾶς
πέτρας καταλείβεται &abstine ὕδωρ.

85-87. ⁴ Me. Ι will give you this pipe,
which has played several not unknown
strams)

85. ‘Ante,’ first—before Ι receive any
thing from you, v. 81. Voss observes
that Menalcas both depreciates and eom·
mends his gift, the one by the epithet
‘ fiagilem,' the other by the mention of its
performances· So ‘ docuit‚' as if the
pipe had suggested the music and the song.

86. Virg., by this allusion to his second
and third EclogueS, seems to identify
himself with Menaloes and his comph-
ments to the memory of Caesar. There
is something awkward in making one
of the characters in this fifth Eclogue the
author of the second and third; but it is
in keeping with the fiction which identifies
the shepherd with the pastoral poet.
[⁴ Formonsum’ originally Pal. and the
Verona fragment3 ‘Alexin,' pat—H. N.
Ver. begins here and continues to vt 21.]

88·90. ‘ Mo. And 1 will give you this
handsome sheep-hook, which I once re-
fused to one whom 1 loved.’

88. There is a similar exchange of pre-
sents in Theocr.. vx 43, and in vn 43 one
shepherd gives another a sheep-hook.
