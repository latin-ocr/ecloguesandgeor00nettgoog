integrat, et maestis late loca questibus implet.

P. VERGILI MARONIS

5¹5

nulla Venu5‚ non ulli animum flexere hymenaei.
solus Hyperboreas glacies Tanaimque nivalem
arvaque Riphaeis numquam viduata pruinis
lustrabat, raptam Eurydicen atque inrita Ditis

dona querens 3 spretae Ciconum quo munere matres 5²0
inter sacra deum nocturnique orgia Bacchi
discerptum latos iuvenem sparsere per agros,

tum quoque marmorea caput a cervice revulsum

515. ‘ Integrat,’ ⁸ renews,’ οι· ‘repeats,’
the nightingale constantly recurring to the
same notes, Hom. (Od. 1. c.) gives the
contrary image, ἥ τε Θαμὰ τρωπῶσα χέει
πολυηχέα φωνήν. ‘Maestis . . . implet,’
perhaps from Lucr. 11 146, ‘liquidis loca
vocibus opplent,’ as Cerda suggests.

516. ‘NullaVenus ε’ [see E. x 12 note]

‘Animum flexere : ’ Catull. Lxlv 330,
‘ Quae tibi flexanimo mentem perfundat
amore.’ The meaning, as it would be ex-
pressed in prose, seems to be, ‘ no passion
bowed his soul, so that he took on him
the yoke of wedlock.’ 1s we choose to
press ‘ non ulli flexere hymenaei,’ under·
standing it of the sostenin influence of
marriage, we may comp. uer. v 1017,
‘ puerique parentum Blanditiis facile in·
genium fregere superbum.’

517. The places mentioned in this and
the following line are doubtless intended
by Virg. to be in or near Thrace, as Heyne
remarkS, since it is not likely that Orpheus
would be represented as wanden-ing far

north os his own country; so that we jected love,

must once more note the poet's loose hand-
ling of geography.

‘ H rboreas,’ 111 196. Trapp says of
this an the next line, ‘ Those verses are
enough to make one shudder at Mid-
summer.’ ι · ’

{issiduffaeliffsimilii'rtl} zzehzg} Luct. v
840, ‘Orba pedum partim, manuum vidu-
ata vicissim.’ Virg. may have chosen
⁸ viduata ' with reference toO heus’ con·
dition, but the thought, even t us slightly
hinted at, would be a mere conceit,

520. ‘ Munus’ is technieally used of
funeral honours (A. ιν 624, v1 686, x1
26, and instances cited by the lexx. ), that
being, according to one opinion (see Ter·
tullian de Spect. 12), the sense which led
to another technical application of the
word, to games, shows, etc. It does not

seem harsb to speak of Orpheus’ constaney
and suffering sorrow as a ‘ munus’ to
Eurydice in this sense, especially as ⁴ quo '
apol ⁰ es for the word with which tt is
,Q sies Εἲς {emm
inzrsslaeable {nemies of the Trojans, as a
‘ munus’ to Dido’s ashes. There would
be considerable probability in the inter·

supported by examples ; but though such
expressions as ‘ vestro munere’ (1 7),

suspect, however, that Asper read ‘quo
nomine,' as the Berne scholia conclude
their note by saying ‘ numine, alii munere’
—fg {iiie munere'then will mean ‘slighted
by t e tribute‚' i.e. seeli themselves
slighted. ‘ S rno’ is specia y used of re·
. 111 74„ A. 1 27, etc.

‘ Matres ’ seems a strange word for the
marriageable women of Thrace (Ov. M.
xl 3 has ‘ nurus Ciconum ⁹), but it is

'ap lied to them as Bacchanals, like θύουσαν

’ ου μητέρα, Aesch. Ag.1235.

521. The story as told by Ovid is that
the Thracian women, while in the midst
os their orgieS, accidentally saw Orpheus,
remembered his scorn, and tore him in
¹³¹}e22N[)Nonius p. 405 reads ‘ divum’

523. The application of ‘marmoreus'
to the body is as old as Lucilius (xxvm
47), ‘ Hic corpus solidum invenie& hic
stare papillas Pectore marmore0,’ where
however the reference seems to be to firm·
ness of flesh rather than to colom.

A ‘ Ca12611ta cervice revulsum ' is from Eun.

nn. 4 2.
