42. ‘Ingredere’ Comp. A. v111 513,
where Evander invites Aeneas to take
command of the Tyrrheniam, and ⁴ Ad-
gredere o magnos, aderit iam tempus,

onores,’ E. lv 48. Caesar then is ealled
upon to enter on his divinit . The other
interpretation, explaining t e word with
reference to ⁸ vine,’ ‘begin to tread the
path,’ seems less likely on account os the
words that follow, ‘ votis iam nunc ad·
suesce vocari!

‘ Votis’ abl. z see on A. v 234.

43-49. ‘ Begin to plough as soon as
winter is over. A fourfold ploughing will
be repaid by an abundant harvest)

43. Columella (u 2, 5 2) tells the farmer
not to wait sor some fixed day, as the
beginning os spring, but to commence
operations before the winter is well over,
say aster the ides of January. ‘ Gelidus
. . . resolvit ' give the reason why this is
the earliest moment sor ploughing.

45. e adjuncts ‘ depres50,’ ‘ inge-

that the ploughing is to be thoro h. So
‘fortes invertant tauri,' v. 65. Τ e lan·

‘ Taurus ’ here and elsewhere for ‘ bos '
or ‘iuvencus’ The ancients neverploughed
with bulls, any more than the moderns.

46. Serv. quotes srom Cato's discourse

to his son, ‘ Vir bonus est, M. fili, colendi
peritus, cuius ferramenta splendent.’ The
notion here ma be of rubbing off the rust
of winter. Medy (second reading and one
or two others have ‘ vomis,’ [and δεῖν.
and the Berne scholia remark on the
double form of the nom.—H. N.]

47. ‘Respondet ε’ see 11 64 note.

47, 48. The eommon practice was to
plough three tima in spring, summer, and
autumn ς where the soil was strong there
was another ploughing in the autumn os
the previous year. So Pliny explains the

‘ Sensit ' refers to the effect os the
ploughing, aster which the land would be

51. The same question is raised by
Varro at the outset of his work (1 iii 4),
and also by Columella (Ι preti), who has
Virg. in his mind. Lucr. 1 296 talks of
the ‘ sacta ac mores ' of the winds.

‘ burst at once,'
