lxiv THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

8. RELICS OF COMMENTARIES PRESERVED IN THE DE
COMPENDIOSA DOCTRINA OF NONIUS (pp. lxiv-lxxxvii).

I strongly suspect that a great many of the observations made by
Probus in his commentaries on ancient usage, as well as other remains

of the work of scholars of the first century A.D., may be recovered from
later writers, and notably from Nonius MarcelluS, the well-known African
scholar of the fourth century. The De Compendiosa Doctrina of N onius
is a medley of mutilated scholarship which, for the sake of convenience,
we may distribute under three heads t first, lexicographical: Books 1, 11,
ιν, v, vl, and part of ΧΠ ; second, grammatical: Books 111, vn, vm,
lx, x, Χῖ, and part of ΧΠ 3 third, antiquarian ε Books xm-xx. The
antiquity of his authorities is sufficiently established by the single fact
that, with four or five exceptions, he quotes no author of later date than
the Augustan age.

Of the lexicographical and antiquarian books I could, did space per-
mit, show that much is ultimately due to Verrius FlaccuS, although Ι
suspect that it came to Nonius through the hands of other scholam, such
as Caesellius Vindex, and Suetonius, The fourth book (De Varia Signi-
ficatione Verborum), which occupies more than a third of the whole
treatise, and is also in point of matter the most important part of it, is
remarkable for the enormous number of quotations from Virgil which it
contains. It may indeed· be said without exaggeration that there are
very few articles in this section in which Virgil is not quoted. This fact
seems to point to the conclusion that the writer from whose works the
fourth book of Nonius was taken, was a great student of Virgil, as well
as (in his way) a lexicographer.

But in the case of the grammatical books of NoniuS, we can go
further, and assert that much of them is distinctly traceable to Pliny and
ProbuS. Taking the third book (De Indiscretis Generibus) first, we may
observe that the subject of doubtful gender had occupied the attention
of grammarians in the first century Aa). So much may be inserted from
the language of Quintilian lx iii 6), who speaks as if he had manuals
before him in which the subject was treated. One of these may have
been the book of ProbuS, De dubiis generibus (probably part of his Silva
Observationum), cited by Priscian (1, p. 169, 171 Keil). Let us proceed
to consider the relation between this work and the third book of
Nonius,

Diomedes in which these observations occur is supposed by Keil (and very plausibly)
to come from Suetonius. If this be the case, the commentary attributed to Probus is
at once stamped as spurious. [Kiibler, de Probi commentariis Vergilianis (Berlin,
1882), suggests that the commentary was written in the fourth century.]

The grammatical treatisoe (Catholicon and Instituta Artium) which bear the name
of Probus are not now, so far as 1 know, attributed by any scholar to Probus of
Berytus: see Keil’s preface to the fourth volume of his Grammatici Latini.
