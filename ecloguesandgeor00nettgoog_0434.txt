P. VERGILI MARONIS

Morborum quoque te causas et signa doceb0. 440
turpis ovis temptat scabieS, ubi frigidus imber
altius ad vivum persedit et horrida cano
bruma gelu, vel cum tonsis inlutus adhaesit
sudor, et hirsuti secuerunt corpora vepreS.

dulcibus idcirco fluviis pecus omne magistri

perfundunt, udisque aries in gurgite villis
mersatur, missusque secundo defluit amni ;
aut tonsum tristi contingunt corpus amurca,
et spumas miscent argenti vivaque sulpura

440-463. ‘ As to the diseases of sheep,
they are liable to scabs from the weather
or from uncleanliness or scratcbes when
new shorn. To remedy this, they are
well washed, or rubbed with ointment
after shearing. Lancing is good, and, in
case of violent inflammation and sever,
bleeding in the feet.'

440. The diseases os sheep and other
cattle are touched upon by Cato xcv1, and
by Varro 11 i, the former talking only of the
scab, the latter, though very briefly, of
othercomplaints. Col. vn 5 goes more sully
into the subject, referring as usual to Virg.

441. ‘Oves frequentius quam ullum
aliud animal infestantur scabie,' Col. l. c.
‘ Temptat,’ E. ι 49. ‘ Frigidus imber‚’ 1

Columella says ‘si tonsum gregem
patiaris silvestribus rubis aut s inis sau·
ciari' (l. c.). He adds two ot er causes
os ⁸ scabies '—lodging in a shed used sor
horseS, mules, or asses, and especially de-
ficiency of food.

siccat,' E. 111 95, where accidental im·

Forcell. instances Curt. lx 8, ‘sumptis
ducibus amnis peritiS, defluxit ad insu-

that the detail may be meant to convey a

448. ‘ Amurca,'1194. Cato(xcvl)says
the ointment should be a compound os
‘amurca,' water in which lupines have
been boiled, and lees of wine, to which
Col. (l. c.) adds white hellebore, if the
ointment is used as a cure, not as a pre-

salt water. Varro (11 xi) prescribes wine
and oil, mixed, accordi to some, with
white wax and hog's lar . Virg.’s list of
ingredients is much more formidabit·
than either. Many of them, Keightley
remarkS, are needlesS, as in nearly all
the receipts to be met with in ancient

‘ Contingunt: ’ see on v. 403. Here
however it might be from ‘ contingu0.'

449. ‘Spumas . . . argenti,' litharge
os silver, i.e. as Keightley explains it,
the oxide or scum that forms on the sur·
sace of silver, or of lead containing silver,
