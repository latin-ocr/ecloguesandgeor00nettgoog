P. VERGILI MARONIS

et nemora evertit multos ignava per annos,
antiquasque domos avium cum stirpibus imis

nam ieiuna quidem clivosi glarea ruris

which is good for corn. ‘Aut ’ then
refers grammaticany either to the sentence
‘nigra [eress etc„ or to “non ullo ex

‘evertit' and ‘ eruit’ are in material, but

21ο. ‘ Petiercz’ the tense does not
denote rapidity (like ‘ fugere ferae‚' 1
330), but is determined by that of the
preceding verbs.

211. Pliny (xvn 37) uses the words
‘illa post vomerem nitescens,' and quotes

‘ Enituit’ [the quanti of the ῑ may be
due to caesura 3 but see gxcursus to v. 811.

‘At' is ὁ δὲ, as ‘illae’ is at μὲν. The
birds fly; the field on which they lived so
long bri htens under cultivation.

recommends ground such as he has been
mentioning——because soil of a contrary
character is far less productive.

Pliny xvu ²9 and Col. 111 11 say that soil

‘ Chelydri‚’ venomous snakes of am—
phibious nature, mentioned in Lucan lx
711, where they are described as ‘tracti
via fumante chelydri.’ The name water·
tortoise (χὲλυς ὕδωρ) referred to the hard·
ness of the skin.

215. ‘ Creta ’ is generally rendered
cha1k3 but Col. in a passage referred to
on v. 180 identifies it with ‘argilla‚ qua
utuntur figuli? For the notion that it was ’
eaten by certain creatures Keightley refers
to Front. in Geop. vu 12.

The old commentators put a stop aster
‘creta‚’ connected ‘ tofus' and ‘ creta‚'
like ‘ glarea‚’ with ‘ ministrat‚' and under-
stood ‘ negant ’ ‘ men deny,' or as Serv.
[and the Berne scholia] give it specifically,
