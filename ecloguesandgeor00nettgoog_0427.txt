torpent mole nova et summis vix cornibus extant.

360. Thomson's lines (winter, 723
soll.) form a good comment: ‘An icy
gale, oft shifting, o’er the pool Brenthes a
blue film, and in its mid career Arrests
the bickering stream) The language is
from Lucr. vi 626, ‘ mollisque luti con·
crescere crustas?

361. ‘ Ferratus orbis :' from Lucr. vl
551, where ⁸ rotarum ’ is expressed.

362. ‘Illa,’ as in A. 1 33 it seems
equivalent to a repetition of the noun.

Heyne seems right in saying that the
rhythm requires us to’ connect ‘ tulis’
with ‘plaustris ς’ see E. 11 20. The ffeadth
and fiatness of the waggons gives a notion
of weight, as Ladewig rightly understands
it. ⁶ Hos ita aequora,' A. 111 377.

363. ‘xfolgoss as in Lucr. 1 238, gene·
rally or universally3 comp. below v. 494,
A. 111 643. Strabo (ιι C. 74) has an ac·
count from Eratosthenes of the splitting
of a bronze vessel by the cold, commemo-
rated by an inscription in the temple os
Aesculapius [at Panticapaeum} ΜΓ.
Long suggests that the vessel contained
water, which expanded when it became
ice, and burst the bronze.

365. The pools from which they drank
or drew water were frozen to the bottom.
The line is not very clearly connected
with v. 364, but there is no reason to
object to it, as Wund. and Keightley do.

[‘ Vertere,’ intrans. A. x 240 note.]

[‘Lucunae:' Med. ’ 'nally and so
Ribbeck3 good MS. au ority supports
the form in Luer. 111 1031, νι 538, ⁵5²·

'Ilghebpflher MSS. here have ‘lacunae —

366. ‘ Glacie riget horrida barba‚’ A.
1v 251, os Atlas.

367. ‘Non setius:' the snow is as bad
as the frost- '

368. Looking back to v. 352, we must

apparently convict Virg. os an oversight.
Ladewig may be right in sa ' g that the
oxen would be those requir to draw the
‘plaustra,' v. 362. Heyne supposes that
he means to allow some exceptions when
the cattle are turned out to graze, and
that during one of these a snow·storm
eomes on. But this last view can hardly
be said to be borne out by the language.

369. Comp. Thomson, winter, 240,
‘ Drooping‚ the labouring ox Stands
covered o er with snow‚ and then de·
mands The fruit of all his toil.’ Virg.
here simply gives the physical image 3 m

370. ‘ Mole nova‚' the weight of a bulk
not their own; so Heyne, ‘ insolenti.
nempe nivi8,' and Trapp and Martyn
‘ unusual weight.’ ‘Torpent’ expresses
numbness as well as mere o prasion.

372. ‘ Puniceae saeptum ormidine pin-
nae,' A. xu 750. ‘Formido' was the
name of the cord with red feathers which
