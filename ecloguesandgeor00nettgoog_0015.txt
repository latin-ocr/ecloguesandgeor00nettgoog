PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.
(ExTRACTs)

AT the time when I undertook this edition of Virgil in 1852,
I had, as the public are aware, the advantage of being associated
with another editor, the distinguished friend to whom 1 have now
the satisfaction of a second time inscribing it. In 1854 he was
called to other dutieS, which removed him from Oxford, while
they engrossed his time Í¾ and 1 had to continue the work alone.
Those who know him will be able to feel how much he might
have contributed to the illustration of an author one of whose
chief characteristics is his subtle delicacy of expression, and who
requires in those who would appreciate him, not only the power
of an analytical critic, but the sympathy of a practised master of
the Latin language. Even as it is, this volume owes not a little
to Mr. Goldwin Smith's assistance. The EclogueS, the first two
Georgics, and a part of the third we read together. The notes on
the latter part of the first Georgic, the whole of the second, and
the early part of the third, were, to a considerable extent, pre-
pared by us in concert for publication: those on the first five
Eclogues are based on some which he composed by himself: and
many passages in both poems have since been discussed between
uS. The editorial responsibility is however entirely mine, and 1
have exercised it freely with reference to the materials which he
allowed me to use, adding, altering, and suppressing, as 1 deemed
best. One important remark, affecting the interpretation of the
first Eclogue, 1 have thought it right to assign distinctiy to him,
as it appears to me new and valuable (p. 13). On the other hand
1 fear it is not impossible that the notes may betray, here and
there, even after the present revision, a trace of that inconsistency
which is perhaps almost inseparable from a divided editorship,
