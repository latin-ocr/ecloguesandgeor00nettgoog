Est etiam ille labor curandis vitibus alter,
cui numquam exhausti satis est : namque omne quodannis

391. ‘ Complentur,’ teem. Lucretius
uses the word os the conception of women.
There seems no sufficient reason to restrict
the description in this line to vineyards,
though such a restrictiori would accord
withuviv. 4 foll.‚ which are somewhat

paplProfundiss deep. Munro compares
Lucr. v 4'1 ‘ rnemora ac magno montes
silvasque pro undas‚’ and adds that ‘saltus'
are the lawns and long defiles sloping from
the hills to the plains. ‘ Silvae profundae '
recurs A. vn 5153 ‘ caelum profundum'
in E. ιν 51 seems different.]

392. ‘ Honestum‚’ comel . [See lv
2323 A. x 1333 ΧΠ 1555 arro R. R. 11
vi 2, etc.] The look of Bacchus fertilizes
the country, as that of Jupiter (A. 1 255)
calms the sky.

denotes that the offering would be pro·

396. ‘ Colurnis ε ’ Serv. says that hazel
spits were used because the hazel was
injurious to the vine. Comp. v. 299.

397·419. ‘ The dressing of the vine

is an interminable labour: the ground
has constantly to be broken up: when
the leaves are shed, pruning begins:
fastenings have to be provided. When
pruning and tying up are over, you have
still to use the hoe, and still (v. 419) live
in dread of storms.' 1

398. ‘ Exhausti’ = ⁸ exhaustionis ²
(Serv.) ε the participle is construed like a
substantive. Comp. such usagesas ‘ Prius

ticiple, instead os being predicate, is made
genitive, while the labour is in a manner
personified and made the exacting power.
‘ Which is never satisfied by exhaustion!
Comp. A. lx 356, ‘ Poenarum exhaustum
satis est,’ where however the resemblance
is merely external.

‘ Namque ' has here much os the force
of ‘ nempe,' resembling, as Wund. re-
marks, the use of γάρ is such passages as
