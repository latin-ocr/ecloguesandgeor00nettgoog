otherS, seeing rightl that this was not the
natural meaning o the sentence, have
fancied that Meliboeus is made to speak in
the character os a hals-Jealous neighbour,
that so the poet may be able prudently

natural to attribute its expression not to
artifice, but to simplicity. Virg. puts the
praise of his happy lot into the mouth of a
neighbour· whose distresses enable him to

faction would come appropriately from
himself alone. It seems scarcely worth
while with Keightley to connect the
clause with what follows, ‘quamvis . . .
non insueta,’ etc. , ·
