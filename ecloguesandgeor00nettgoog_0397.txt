29. ‘Navali surgentis aere columnaS,'
otherwise called ‘ columnae rostratae,'
and found on the coins of Augustus;
[see e-g. Cohen i p. 82. Serv. says
⁸ Augustus victor totius Aegypti quam
Caesar pro parte superaverat, multa de
navali certamine sustulit rostra, quibus
conflatis quattuor effecit columnas», quae
postea in Capitolio sunt locatae, quas
hodieque conspicimus.’ The Senate in
ΕΟ. 30 ordered that some of these rostra
should adorn the chapel of Julius Caesar.

30. ‘ 1³} iphaten ε ’ a mountain in Arme-
nia, put (as the epithet, routed‚ shows) for
the Armenian hill-men. ⁸ Pulsum ’ might,
however, be used os a river poetically
seigned to be driven back to its source
(see A. XI 405), and it was prob. from
this line and the equally ambiguous
‘ rigidum Niphaten ’ os Hor. Od. 11 ix 20
that later poets and comm. called Ni-
phates a river: see Iuv. vl 4053 Lucan

ConS. Hon. 71 ; Serv. here, etc.]

31·33. [Imitated by Prop. ιν viii 53
(111 ix), writing of the same events of B.C.
3o·29: ‘ prosequar et currus utroque ab
litore ovanteS, Parthorum astutae tela
remissa fugae.' ‘Parthum,' like ‘ Gan-
aridum’ v, 27, is an exaggeration, for
{ctavian did not touch Parthia in 30·29‚
and the standards lost by Crassus and
Antony were not recovered till 20. It is
not necessary to suppose (with Con. and
others) that the line was added in 25 or
20. ‘ Utroque ab litore ’ is not clear.
Mr. Nettleshi referred to the Morini,

45 and Octavian in 34. But (1) the
wording of the line does not require four
victories, and (2) the victor-ies selected

are hardly such as we should expect
here. Perhaps vv. 32, 33 mean only
‘victories in East and West,’ summing
up the whole list of conquered lands from
v. 25 onwardS.]

over each. Some take it, twice apiece:
but this will not agree so well with ‘ duo
tropaea.'

34. ‘Stabunt,’ on separate pedestals or
on the pediment. When the deeds of
Augustus are commemorated, the mythical
glories of his ancestors are also to be

‘ Troiae Cynthius auctor: ’ comp. Hor.
od. 111 iii 65, ‘Ter si resurgat murus
aheneus Auctore Phoebo.' Apollo is
perhaps introduced as the tutelar god
and reputed father of Augustus (Keight-
ley).
