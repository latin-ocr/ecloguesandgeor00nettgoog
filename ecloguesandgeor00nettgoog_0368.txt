P. VERGILI MARONIS

credere; nec metuit surgentis pampinus austros
aut actum caelo magnis aquilonibus imbrem,

sed trudit gemmas et frondes explicat omnis,

335

non alios prima crescentis origine mundi
inluxisse dies aliumve habuisse tenorem
crediderim: ver illud erat, ver magnus agebat
orbiS, et hibernis ’ parcebant flatibus Euri:

cum primae lucem pecudes hausere, virumque

340

terrea progenies duris caput extulit arviS,
immissaeque serae silvis et sidera caelo.
nec res hunc tenerae possent perferre laborem,

cp. Hor. Od. ιν vii 1.] ‘Credunt se in
novos soles ’ is probably a condensation os
‘credunt se solibus’ and ‘trudunt se in
soleS,' possibly with a further reference to
the expression ‘in dies! ‘ Soles ’ are the
suns of each day ς they are ‘ novi‚' because
they are the beginning of the warm season.
Virg. probably had m mind Lucr. v 780
soll,
ventures to encounter them with sasety.
The young vine-branch has no sear that
the south wind will get up, or that the
mighty north will send a burst os rain, but
puts out its buds, and unsolds all its leaves, ’

336. ‘ Crescentis ' -- ‘ nascentis‚' which
Bentley on Manil. 11 428 wished to read.
This and the following lines mean that
the world was born in spring3 not that
the first es of the world were perpetual
spring. ‘ Alias ’ PaL—H. N.]

338. ‘Ver illud erat:’ comp. A. 111
173, ‘ Nec sopor illud erat.’ 1t was
springtide that the great globe was keep-
ing.’ Cerda comp. Catull. vam 16,
‘ Iucundum cum aetas florida ver ageret.'

339. ‘Hibemis,' etc.: there was no
sign of winter. ‘ Parcebant flatibus,' like
the common phrase ⁴ parcere alicui‚'
spared them, that is, sorbore to put them
forth. [Med. has ‘ hiberni.'—-}l. N.]

340. ‘ Haurio’ is used for drinking
through the eyes and ears as well as
through the mouth, A. lv 359, x 899.
But light and air are not unsrequently
consounded, pure ether being supposed
to be liquid flame.

341. [‘ Terrea ι’ Med. corr„ Philar-
iffiussfidsiff'ffissi'ssssffyanifaiianti<¹⁰³3&ss
Be'ntley on Hor. Epod. 11 18 and Niunro.
‘ T errea ' means born of, or made of earth :
sor ‘duris' comp. Lucr. v 925, ‘genus

‘As new suns dawn, the herbage

humanum multo suit illud in arvis Durius,
ut decuit, tellus quod dura creasset‚' but
the epithet (which has puzzled commen·
tators) may be meant to continue the idea
of spring, when the fields cease to be
frost-bound. Med. and most MSS„ the
Bernescholia‚ Anthol. Lat. xvu 229 (p. 57
Riese) and the Lemma in Serv. ive
⁸ ferrea‚' which was accepted by on.
Bentley very naturally objects that no
poet on earth would have made the iron
age the tirst.]

342. The stars are looked on as living
inhabitants οἱ heaven, as the men of
earth, and the heasts of the woods; Ov.

M. 1 73,

‘ Neu regio soret ulla suis animantibus orba,

Astra tenent caeleste solum formaeque
deorum,

Cesserunt nitidis habitandae piscibus
undae,

Terra seras cepit, volucres agitabilis aer.'

See also G. lv 227 (note).

343. This verse, with the two follow·
ing, refers to the beneficence of spring
generally.

‘Res tenerae' are the young planta
buds, etc„ not like ‘ipse tener mundi
concreveritorbis' in E. vl 34. Comp. Lucr.
1 179, ‘et vivida tellus Tuto res teneras
effert in luminis oras)

‘ Hunc laborem,' all the trials to which
plants are exposed. So the word is ap-

lied to things inanimate 1 79, 150, and

low, v. 372. Comp. Luer. v 1213,
‘ quoad moenia mundi Solliciti motus
hunc possint serre laborem.' [⁸ Possint’

‚Meet-H. N.]

‘ Sufferre,’ the first reading of Med„ is
perhaps not improbable, as the less com·
mon word ; but it would be hazardous to
