P. VERGILI MARONIS

et quac mane refert et quae surgentibus astriS.

ille ubi nascentem maculis variaverit ortum
conditus in nubem medioque refugerit orbe,
suspecti tibi sint imbres; namque urget ab alto
arboribusque satisque Notus pecorique sinister.

aut ubi sub lucem densa inter nubila sese

diversi rumpent radii, aut ubi pallida surget
Tithoni croceum linquens Aurora cubile,

tam multa in tectis crepitans salit horrida grand0.

of rain: a cloudy or pale sunrise of hail.
At sunset, dark grey spots denote rain,
fiery red wind, a mixture of the two rain
and wind. But a clear rising and setting
betoken clear weather.’

The first part of the assage is closely
imitated from Arat. 87 oll.

439. ‘Secuntur,' attend. Med. and two
of Ribbeck’s cursives read ‘ sequentur.'

440. ⁸ Refert,' probably of recurrence ε
see on v. 249. ‘ surgentibus astriS,’ at
sunset. [Med. has ‘ austris.'—H. N.]

441. Virg. has here mixed tw0‚ and,
unless ‘ que ’ in the next line is to be taken
for ⁴ ve,’ three signs which are separate in
Aratus, ‘ Nascentem,’ etc. , is a translation
of ποικίλλοιτο νὲον βάλλοντος ἀρούρας
κύκλος, and ‘ medioque refugerit orbe ' of
κοῖλος ἐειδόμενος περιτέλλῃ, which is trans-
laff» by Avienus ‘ medioque recedens
or .

442. ‘ Condo ’ is naturally constructed
here, as in v. 438, as a verb of motion,
as it means strictly not ‘ to hide,' but ‘to
throw together' (comp. ‘ coniei0,’ ‘ con-
to ueo ’ .

‘ edi)oque refugerit orbe:’ either (1)
recedes from the middle of his disc to the
circumfeoence, or (2) retires in respect of
the middle of his disc. Lucan, v 544, has
a similar line, speaking of sunset ε ‘ Orbe
quoque exhaustus medio languensque
recessit) As in the case of the moon,
Virg. has picked out salient points from
Aratus’ lengthy enumeration. [Consentius
p. I2319BNK:¹ quotes the line with ‘ refulserit!

443. ‘ Urget ' without a case, A. x 433.
There is the same doubt about ‘ab alto'
here as about ‘ex alto‚' v. 324. The

450

sense ‘ from the deep ’ is truer to nature3
‘from on high ' perhaps more like Virg. ⁸

‘Sese diversr rumpent’ is σχιζόμενω.
‘ Sese rumpent' = ‘erumpent‚' as ιιι Α.

though the phenomenon is the same, its
significance is totally opposite. [Pliny
