279. The birth of‘Coeus’and ‘Ia e-
tus’ is mentioned Hes. Theog. 134, t at
of ‘ TyphoeuS,' ib. 821 foll„ the latter not
taking place till after the expulsion of the
Titans from heaven. The two former
were the sons of Earth and UranuS, the
latter of Barth and Tartarus. ‘ Typhoeus ’
is distinguished by the epithet ‘ saevus,’
as he was the most sormidable (Hes. l. c. ).

‘ Creat : ' see on E. vm 45. ⁶ Typhoea’
is probably a trisyllable, the two last
vowels coalescing (comp. ‘ Orphea,’ E. vr
30), as in Greek (Τυφωέα), though it
might be scanned as a dactyl‚ see 11 69.

280. It is doubtful whether ‘ fratres’
refers to the ' t-brood generally, or to
the two Aloifflatel.² The deeds mentioned
in the following lines are ascribed to the
latter by Hom. (Od. xl 304 foll.), and
by Virg. himself (A. vl 582, where the
words ‘ rescindere caelum ' recur): but
the Aloidae were the sons of Poseidon
and Iphimedeia‚ not of Earth. Possibly
Virg. misunderstood the passage in the
Odyssey, where they are said in Homeric
phrase to have been nourished by the
earth, though the word there used is
“Qffgcindeoe ' may be to break open,
like ‘ vias rescindere,’ Lucr. 11 406, or it
may be compared with Aesch. Prom. 357
(of Typhoeus) ὡς τ-ἠν Διὸς τυραννίδ’
ἐκπέρσων βίᾳ.

281. Ὄσσαν ἐπ’ Οὐλύμπῳ μέμασαν θέμεν,
αὐτὰρ ἐπ’ 'O Πὴλιον εἰνοσίφυλλον, ἵν’
σὺρανὸς ἀμβατ ς εἴη, Hom. l. c. Virg.
reverses the positions os Pelion and
Olympus, and transfers to the latter the
epithet attached to the former.

The non-elision of the ‘i ' and ‘ o ' and
the shortening of the ‘ o ' are in imitation
of the Greek rhythm‚ and are appropriate
here and elsewhere where the subject
reminds us of Greek poet .

282. ‘ Scilicet,' agreeably to its etymo-

logy (‘ scire licet ’), introduces an expla-
nauon or development. Here it intro-
duces the details os the conspiracy.

‘ Involvere ’ is used in its strict sense of
rolling upon, like ‘involvitur aris‚’ A. κη
292. Olympus is heaved up the sides of
Ossa. Pal. originally had ‘ invertere.'

283. The threefold attempt seems to be
Virg.’s invention.

284. ‘Septima post decimam,’ the
seventeenth‚ as is evident from Hes.
Works 805, where the seventeenth follows
the fifth immediately, though the work
which he assigns to it is not the same as
here. Of the works which Vir-g. assigns
to the seventeenth‚ planting isreferred by
Hes. to the thirteenth‚ taming cattle to
the fourteenth, weaving to the twelfth.

‘Ponere,’ ‘plant in order,' 11 273, Ε 1
74. ‘ Felix ponere: ’ see v. 213, E. v 2.

285. ‘Prensos domitare‚’ perhaps for
‘ prendere et domitare ε ’ πρηΰνειν em χεῖρα
τιθείς, Hes· v. 797. Taking in hand is
the 20th step towards breaking in. Comp.
111 , 7.

⁸ Licia telae addere,’to add the leashae to
the warp, to weave. Tibull. 1 vi 78,
‘ Firmaque conductis adnectit licia telis.’

286. ⁴ F ugae ’ seems to refer to fugitive
slaves. Virg. however, as Heyne remarks»,
is speakin not in their interest, but in
that of the usbandman, who is warned to
be on his guard that day, while on the
other hand he need not watch against
thieveS. In Hesiod the ninth day is
merely mentioned as good for work of
any sort. ⁸ Contraria furtis: ’ ‘avibus
contraria cunctis,’ Lucr. vl 741.

287-296. ‘ Some work is fittoet for night
or early morning, mowing for instant-,03
and long winter evenings may be well
spent by the husbandman in cutting
torches, by his wife in weaving, or boiling
and skimming.’
