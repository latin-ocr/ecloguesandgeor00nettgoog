the birthda was kept 4 Id. 1u1.‚ the day

before the udi Apollinares began.

The resent reading was restored by
Heins. rom the best MSS„ for ⁸ duoque
altaria‚' which is supported only by Serv.
on A. 111 305.

67. These offerings are from Theocr.
v 53, 57, where they are made to the
nymphs and Pan. ‘ Bina,' two in the
year: see below, v. 70. No distinction is
meant between ‘ pocula bina ' and ‘ duo
crateres,’ as the passage in Theocr. shows.

68. Some editors have ‘crateresz’ but
V irg. follows throughout the Greek
form, of which ‘ crateras’ is the acc. pl.

‘ Statuere ’ is appropriate both to ‘ crate·
ras’ (from the size of the ‘ crater ’), and
to the act of sacrificing. A. 1 728, ‘ Crate-
ras magnos statuunt.’ Hor. S. 11 iii 199,
⁴ pro vitula statuis dulcem Aulide natam
Ante aras.' The milk would be appro-
evriate to spring, the oil to autumn, as

agn. remarkS, comparing Suet. Aug. 31,
where it is said that Augustus ordered the
‘ compitales Lares ² to be crowned twice a
year, with spring and summer flowers.
‘ Olivum ' for ⁸ oleum ’ is poetical.

69. Theocr. vu 63. ‘In primis,’
because he had previously mentioned milk
and oil. ‘Convivia‚’ the feast after the
sacrifice.

It is just possible that ‘multo’ might
be an error for ‘mulso’ (see note on G.
ὃ 344) z but ‘ multo Baccho ' occurs again

70. ’9ξί frigus—si messis ς ’ it is not
easy to determine the festivals indicated by
these two seasons. Virg. appears to have
had some definite reference in his mind,
from his language in vv. 67, 68, 74, 75.
The latter p e speaks of a festival to
¹the nymphs, an another at the ‘lustratio

ffi‘ss'assssnfpedgecr‘i’ssgd i⁵0 evlidggiyoltlhff
, . . ‚
the first is rather Sicilian than Italian,
the nymphs, as Keightley remarks, not
forming? part of the old Roman mytho·
logy,w ile sacrifices to them are uently
mentioned by Theocritus, though e no·
where speaks of an annual festival in their
honour. Yet it is difficult to identify
either ‘ frigus ' or ‘ messis ' with ‘Ambar-
valia.' They took place ‘extremae sub
casum hiemiS, iam vere seren0,' when
‘ densae in montibus umbrae ’ (Virg. l.c.)‚
i.e. towards the end of A ril: yet they
could hardly be indicated ξ ‘ messi& as
they were expressly intende to commend
the young crops to Ceres some time before
the harvest, and are distinguished as such
from another festival at or after the harvest
(Tibull. 11 i 21 foll.). There were certain
‘ messis feriae' (Dict. A. ‘ F eriae ²), which
took place in the summer. The Lares
were adored at the ‘ Ambarvalia’ (Tibull.
bdemdfl 1tllie1 ⁷333, the Rgnvisagdaegycrl a}
σαυίᾳῐιιιὴίῐις heroes. See Hor. Od. 1v v
31 o .

71. Ariusia in Chios was famous for
its wine, [ἄριστος τῶν Ἑλληνικῶν (Strabo
645, Pliny xlv 73). Greek wines were
familiarin Ital before and in Virg.'s time,
butthe epithet {ere may be merely literary.
‘ Novum nectar' would naturally mean
⁶ new-made wine,' but the appropriateness
of the idea is not obvious. Serv. para·
phrases ‘ magna dulcedo.']

‘ Calathus ' (more commonly a work·
basket, or wool-basket) is a cup here and

motus incompositos et carmina dicat,' G.
1 3‘Sgyctius’‚ Lycta‚ in Crete, A. 111 401,
of Idomeneus. The supposed joy of the
woodland deities (v. 58, comp. V1 27) is
imitated by the shepherdS.
