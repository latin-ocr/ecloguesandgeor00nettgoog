to exclude him from the benefit of a similar plea, if indeed it
should not suggest fresh matter for consideration with regard to
the laws generally, and probably with justice, supposed to dis·
tinguish the two great schools of Ancient and Modern Art.
This, however, is not the only kind of confusion by which
the pastoral reality of the Eclogues is disturbed or destroyed.
Not only is the Sicilian mixed up with the Italian, but the
shepherd is mixed up with the poet. The danger was one to
have been apprehended from the first. So soon as pastoral
poetry came to be recognized as a distinct species, the men of
r letters who cultivated it, perhaps themselves grammarians or
professional critics, were likely to yield to the temptation of
painting themselves in bucolic colours, instead of copying the
actual bucolic life which they saw or might have seen in the
country. They started 'from the position that shepherds, besides
being subjects for poetry‚ were themselves singers and lovers of
song 3 it was not difficult to convert the proposition, and assume
that a pastoral singer might be spoken of as a shepherd. A
symptom of this failing appears even in TheocrituS, in whose
seventh Idyl the speaker, describing himself as being in company
with a poetical goatherd, modestly declines a comparison with
the professed poets Asclepiades and Philetas, thereby intimating
that he is himself a professed poet in disguise¹ In Moschus the
identification is more consciously realized.² Bion is bewailed as
the ideal herdsman, for whom Apollo and the wood-gods wept,
whose strains drew looks of love from Galatea, and whose pipe
even the lips of Pan may scarcely touch. Those, however, who
wish to see to what extent it may be interwoven with the texture
of a series of poem3‚ should look for itin the Eclogue& They
will not have very far to seek ; indeed it meets them at the very
threshold. Nothing but the extreme awkwardness of the manner
in which it is introduced into the first Eclogue could have pre·
vented the critics from recognizing it at once. As it is, they

οὐ γάρ πω, κατ’ ἐμὸν νόον, οὔτε τὸν ἐσθλὸν
&anatome νὶιεημι τὸν ἐκ Σάμω, οὔτε Φιλητάν,
ἀείδων, βάτραχος δέ ποτ’ ἀκρίδας ὥς τις ὲρίσδω.
