62. ‘ Cogendae in sulcum,' drilled into
trenches, on the analogy os ‘cogere in

ordinem,’ giving the notion of trainlng and*

discipline.

‘ Multa mercede,’ at great costos labour.
Comp. Sen. de Tranq. xl, ‘Magna
quidem res tuas mercede colui.'

64. ‘ Respondent ι ’ ‘votis respondet
avari agricolae,' 1 473 [osten in Col„
Cato ap. Plin. xvut 17.—-H. N.] The
word is sometimes, as here, used abso·
lutely. Col. 111 2, ‘ Gemella vitis maior

‘ Truncis ' and ‘ propagine ’ are ablatives
os the instrument. Five os the six methods
(v. 22·34) are here mentioned ; the ‘ cacu-
men] (v. 29) is omitted. The instance os
the olive in both cases seems to identify
‘ truncis’ with ‘ caudicibus sectis,’ v. 303
and if this is so, ‘solido de robore’ must
answer to ‘stirpeS,’ ‘sudeS‚’ ‘vaIIOS,’ v.
24, 25, in spite of the testimony of Serv.
as to the applicability of ‘ caudicibus
sectis' to the myrtle‚ quoted on v. 31.
But (see v. 30 note) lt is not easy to
decide.

65. ‘ Et durae : ’ Serv. [and the Berne
scholia] mention another reading, ‘ edurae,'
which is found in some inferior MSS.;
[Serv. explains it as = ‘ non durae. ’—
H. N. Ribbeck reads ‘ecdurae' asin

an attributive gen„ like ‘gratum litus
amoeni secessus,’11uv. 111 4, [or perhaps
rather descriptive.

67. ‘ Chaonii patris ε ’ so ‘ Lemnius
pater,’ A. vm 454. ‘ Chaonii ’ = ‘ Do·
donaei.’

68. ‘ Nascitur,’ sc. ‘plantis,’ which we
should have expected to be repeated, as
the more important word ; but the repeti·
tion os the verb is meant to remind us of
the rest os the ex ression of which it has
formed a part. vge may perhaps compare
the half repetitions of words in Homer.

the Berne scholia and two MSS.; it is

time.
