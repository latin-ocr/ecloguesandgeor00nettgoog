BUCOLICA. ECL. IV.

incipe, parve puer: cui non risere parenteS,
nec deus hunc mensa, dea nec dignata cubili est.

Ten months was recognized by the Roman
law as the full period of gestation.

The writers of most of the cursiveS,
not knowing that ⁸ tulerunt,' ‘steterunt,'
etc„ are recognized by the mmarians,
give ‘ tulerint, or ‘ tulerant,' and Ribbeck
thinks that ‘ tulerint ' was the original
readi of Pal. SerV. mentions a variant
‘ abstu erint,’ which is not found in any
of Ribbeck’s MSS.—H. N.]

62. ‘ Delay no longer; if thou dost,
thou wilt forfeit the love of thy parentS,
who are already weary with waiting, and
a child whom his parents do not love can
never become a hero or enjoy a hero's
reward '—like Hercules, who (Hom. od.
xl 601) μετ’ ἀθανάτοισι Θεοῖσι 'ripn-erat ἐν
θαλίης καὶ ἔχει καλλίσφυρον“Ἠβην. Comp.
also Hor. Od. ιν viii 30.

similar are . vu 7, G. 1 343, etc. It has

been usually assumed that ‘ risere ' governs
the dative, ‘ smiled on him,’ but there is
no authorit sor such an use.]

A remar able various reading is pre·
served by Quintilian (lx 3), ‘qui non
risere parentes,’ the int os his quotation
being the chan e 0 number as exem li—
fied in ‘qui' ollowed by ‘huna’ e
sense would agree well with ‘ risu cogno-
scere,’ as just explained, but the transi·
tion from ⁴ qui' to ‘ hunc ² would be
inexcusably harsh in a sim le passage,
and the construction ‘ ridere a iquem,' ‘ to
smile on a person,’ is not sufficiently sup-
ported by Plaut. Capt. 111 i 21, where
some notion of mockery is intended, as a

arasite is speaking. Probabl Quint.
Found ‘quoi in his copy, an read it
‘ qui ' rather than ‘ cui.’ [Bonnell, in his
ed. of Quintilian, conjectured ‘qui non
risere parenti ’ (see Class. Review vii 200.)
As is pointed out above, there is no autho-
rity for this use of ‘ rideo ² with dat.]
