Arcades,
27. The details vouch for the reality of

the vision, rhaps in a spirit of rustic
simplicity. th the Greeks and Romans

seem not infrequently to have painted
their gods red (see Plutarch, Q. Rom. 98,
and other es referred to by Voss),
especially perhaps the deities os the
country, such as Bacchus and Priapus,
which probably accounts for the trick
played on Silenus in vt 22. In Tibull.
11 ι 55 the rustic worshipper of Bacchus
paints himself with vermilion (⁴ minium '):
and Pliny tells us (xxxtu 111) that the
bodies of generals who triumphed were
coloured with the same substance.

‘ The Latin ‘⁸ minium ”was the sulphide
of mercury, the Greek κιννάβαρι, our
cinnabar or vermilion. It came from
Spain, whose quicksilver mines of Alma·
den are still prolific.' Keightley. [Corpus

experience, ‘ bethinking him,’ in Keats'
words, ⁴ how melancholy loath he was to
lose sair Syrinx.’

29, 3ο. Pan, as the tron of rural life,
chooses his images rom the country.
Voss observes that he is elsewhere con-
nected with bees, bein called μελισσοσόος
(Anth. Pal. lx 226), w ile honeyisoffered
to him, Theocr. v 58. Is it merely by
accident that in the song to Pan, just
quoted, in Keats’ Endymion, book 1,
⁸ yellow-girted bees' are said to ‘ fore·
doom their golden honeycombs ' to him ?

‘Gramina rivis:' see 111111, G. 1 269.

⁸ Cytiso apest' ‘Cytisum in agro esse
quam plurimum maxime refert, quod gal·
linis, apibus, ovibus, capriS‚ bubus quoque
et omni generi pecudum utilissimus est,'
Col. v 12. Itis not named in G. w.
⁴ Fronde ’ seems to mean leaves stri ped

Let me be remembered in your songs,
Arcadians3 would that I only had been
one of you, living your life and enjoyi
mygove {given Lycoris might have stay
wi me en.

31. Doubts about the pointing of this
line existed as early as the time of Serv„
who ⁶ htly decides that ‘tamen’ forms
part o Gallus’ speech. Wagn. seems
right in saying that the word here naturally
introduces a consolatory thought, as in
A. lv 329, x 509, though he spoils the
effect by referring it directly to what goes
before: ‘licet sciam nullum amoris esse
remedium in luctu et lacrimis, iuvat
tamen indulgere huic dolori, quod meos
amores non tacebunt Arcadiae pastores.’
Serv. shows a truer appreciation: ‘ licet
ego duro amore consumar, tamen erit
solacium, quia meus amor erit vestra can·
tilena quandoque‚’ adding, not less justly,
⁴ videtur enim neque obiurgationes nessue
re o ti·

dicta ab

consolationes (sc. deorum) reci
nate moriturus: nihil enirn a
eis respondit.' In English we may per·
haps express it, ‘you will sing for me,
though, when 1 am gone.’

‘Cantabitis ’ has an imperative sense,
asin G. tv 105,Hor. E . 1 xiii 2, etc„ the
speaker assuming what Re desireS. ‘ Quies·
cant,’ v. 33, shows that it is not an ordinary
future. [Roby 15893 the use is common
both in command and in prohibition.]

32. ⁸ Montibus,' dative, as ιι 5, ⁸ Mon·
tibus et silvis studio iactabat inani,'
rather than local ablative.

⁶ Haec‚' explained by ‘meos amore&
v. 34.

Pal. and one of Ribbeck's cursives
originally had ‘ nostriS‚' out of which
Ribbeck extracts ‘ vostris.’

‘Soli cantare periti Arcades' may be
either a vocative m apposition, or a sepa-
rate sentence, ‘ none but Arcadians know
how to sing‚' which last seems preferable.
For the general sense comp. vn 4 note.

the common ⁴ Sit tibi terra levis'
