nec moritura super crudeli funere virg0.

255. The wild boar has been named
v, 248, so Serv. and others suppose that
virg. here means the tame one, which they
think explains the force of ‘ ipse.’ Lade·
wig quotes Varro 11 1, to show that the
name ‘sus ’ was restricted by some to the
tame sort. But the dignity of the language
would pass into burlesque if applied to the
domestic swine, and the facts mentioned
here agree with Aristotle's description of
the wild boar, H. A. vl 17. ‘Ipse’ is
apparently meant to prepare the reader
for somethin exalted, and the monosyl-
labic ending( uer. v 25, ‘horrens Arcadius
sus ') is in keeping. ‘ sabellicus ’ similarly
recalls the woods and mountains of Sam·
nium.

256. ‘ Prosubigit ' is quoted only from
Val. Fl. tv 288 (of the Cyclops forging the
thunderbolt) and Prudentius, περὶ areop.
111 129, where it is used in the sanie sense
as here, with ⁸ pede.’ ‘ Subigere' is sre-
quently used of breaking up land (11 50),
and this may be the reference here, with
the addition of ‘ pro ' to denote the forward
action of the feet, as in ⁴ proculco‚' ‘ pro-
ter0.' Serv. sayS‚ ‘fodit‚ et pedibus irn-

llit alternis.' Aristot. l. c. speaks of
ἔατε as πρὸς ἀλλήλους μὲν ποιοῦντες μάχας
θαυμαστὰς θωρακὶζοντες ἑαυτοὺς καὶ ποι-
οῦντες τὸ δέρμα ὡς παχύτατονέκ παρασκευῆς,
πρὸς τὰ δένδρα διατρίβοντες καὶ τῷ πηλῷ
μολύνοντες πολλάκις καὶ ξηραίνοντες ἑαυ-
τούς. ‘ Arbore ’ may be either the instru-
mental or the local ablative.

257. The first ⁴ atque ' couples ‘ durat '
to the other verbs, the second joins ‘ hinc ’
to ⁸ illinc.' ‘ Umeros ’ Med. Gud. ; ‘ ume-
rosque’ (Pal. Rom.) gives a feebler sen·
tence.

258. He glauces at the story of Leander
to show what love can make men do.
Martyn remarks on the judgment which
leads him to avoid mentioning it expressly‚

thereby representing the action as which
the whole species would do.

Some such verb as ‘ facit ’ is to be
understood with ‘quid,’ as also in v. 264
Comp. Hor. Ep. 1 ii 10, ⁸ Quid Paris? ut
salvus regnet vivatque beatis Cogi posse
negat.’ ‘ What of the youth whose mar-
row the fierceness of love has turned to
flame ? '

[⁴ Cui ‘ is dat. for gen„ the so-called
‘dat. energicus,' very common in poetry
with pronouns: cf. A. x, 745, ‘ olli dura
gffsszdoefflleoseix'. i'n υἷῧὲἷῇῑῑιῗῖᾚςὴξ viii
42. See v. 347 also.]

‘Versat ’ merely expresses the motion
within, as in lv 83, ‘ Ingentis animos an-
gusto in pectore versant.’

259. ‘ Abruptis,’ as Heyne remarks,
has the force of ⁸ abrumpentibus,' like
⁴ mare proruptum‚’ A. 1 245.

261. ‘ Porta caeli: ' comp. Hom. 11. v
749, vni 393, πύλαι μύκον οὐρανοῦς En-
nius Epigr. ⁴ mi soli caeli maxima porta
patet; the actual words ‘quem . . .
caeli ' are ascribed to Ennius in an anon.
fragm. [probably in error (Vahlen Ann.
595 ; Miiller p. 139).] Virg. probably
means that the gate of heaven is opened to
let out the storm and the noise of its open·
mg‘ ξεῑέἰὲῐξιξιῐιιῖξέῑᾎ ἓίῗιξὲειῐίηξζ 1liis daring
(Martyn). This is more poetica] than the
usual rendering, ‘ rebellow.'

262. Leander is warned by the thought
of his parents, who would call him back
in agony if they knew his danger. This
explanation seems established b the next
line, as Hero, sar from calling im back,
was waiting for him.

263. ‘ Super ' may mean either ‘ there-
upon‚’ or literally ‘on his body’ (Ladewig) z
