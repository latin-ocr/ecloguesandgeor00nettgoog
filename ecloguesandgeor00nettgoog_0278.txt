sor ‘nonnu110‚’ which is found in Gud.
Pier. mentions another reading, ‘ nullo
de ς’ Rom. unmetrically gives ‘non ullo de.’

The abl. is descripnve of ‘ fruges) The
distinction is 3 general one between nature
and cultivation, not, as in 11 10-13,
between spontaneous productiori and pro·
duction by seed.

24. This invocation of Caesar is pro-
bably, as Keightley observa, the first
specimen os the kind. It was followed
by Lucan and Statius, the former invoking
Nero, the latter Domitian.

‘Adeoz ’ see on E. tv ιι. ‘Mox ’ has
been thought to contain a bad compli-
ment 3 but the poet's resent object is to
say that his patron 111111> be deified, not to
wish that 1115 (133111 may be delayed.
Comp. v 503.

25. ‘ Concilia’ seems to rnean merely
company or society, as in Cic. Tusc. 1 30,
⁶ seclusum a concilio deorum.' ‘ Of whom
we know not in what house os gods thou
art in good time to sit.’

⁸ Urbis) Some understand ‘ urbis '
(genitive) os Rome, and connect ‘invisere '
with ‘ curam.' It is more natural to con-
fine ‘ invisere ’ 10 ‘ urbis,’ and make
‘ curam ’ the object of ‘ veliz-„² as indeed
is ‘ invisere,’ rightly regarded. So in
Hor. Od. 1 i 4 ‘collegisse‘ is virtuall
3 nominative, and as such is joined wi
⁴ meta) Gell. x111 21 says that ‘ ur-
bisne ’ was found in 3 copy corrected by
Virg.'s own hand, but he regards it as
acc. l.

27.p ‘ Auctorem ’ has its full etymologica]
force, ⁸ augere ' and its cognates being
repeatedly used of vegetable growth. ⁴ Ad
fruges augendas atque animantis,’ Lucr. v
80. [Serv. however and the Berne scholia
take it 35 · parent, creator : ’ ‘ qui frugibus
et ceteris rebus originem praestas. ’—H. N.
In his Contr. to Latin Lexicograph , Mr.
Nettleship suggests that ⁸ auctor ’ here:

increaser, from ‘ augere τ ’ 311 other uses
of ‘ auctor' he derives from 3 1051 verb,
ι augggg’ptecgtzetlgggtdgcl ειῃς1331113111 ’ occurs
again A. 1 80, 111 52 , where it seems
to mean storms rather than, as here,
weather generally ς but the repetition may
teach us that the different meanings are
not likely to have been discriminated in
Virg.’s mind so sharply as in ours. ‘ The
giver of its increase, and lord of its
changesul seasons. '

28. ‘ Cingens materna tempora myrt0,‘
nearly repeated A. v 73. For the con·

Venus, E. tx 47. The myrtle coronation
sefems to be meant as an acknowledgment
o ro lt '.

the god of the unmeasured sea, the sole

wer to claim the seaman’s homage, with
urthest Thule to be thy handmaid, and
Tethys buyi thee as husband sor her

waves.

‘ Deus‚' the god, not a god, as is shown

by ‘ sola, ultima Thule' (expressing the
extctlent of the dominion) and ⁶ omnibus
un ts)
, ‘ ‘Inmensi mari5‚’ Lucr. 11 590, the
..fffiiaffsogffifggmgrihe same as ⁶ in· ’
visere' and ‘ accipiat ’ above. Con. took
it = ‘become,' but his parallels (Iuv. 11
83, V1129) are erroneous, and there seems
to be no real example of ‘venio’ in this
sense.

Berne scholia notice that Virg.'s use of
‘ emo ⁹ here 1135 intentional reference to the
ancient ceremony of ‘ coemptio. ⁹—H. N.]
