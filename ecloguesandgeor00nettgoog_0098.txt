1 7. IUNIUS PHILARGYRIUS.

The fragment of a commentary on the Eclogues, bearing the title
Philargyrii ExplanationeS‚ is preserved in three manuscripts (Lauren-
tianuS, plut. XLV, cod. 14, tenth century3 Parisinus 7, 960, tenth century3
Parisinus 11 ,308, of the same date). And an incomplete commentary
on the Georgics, of excellent quality, but with large gapS, which gives
the impression of the work as we have it being a series of extractS, has
been since the time of Ursinus assigned likewise to Iunius PhilargyriuS.
M. Thomas, in his essay upon Servius (p. 277), observes that the narne
of Philargyrius is not, in a single MS„ prefixed to these scholia. This
fact would of course, if taken by itself, be sufficient to throw grave
doubt upon our right to assign the notes to PhilargyriuS. But it must
also be observed that the Berne scholia, of which more anon, often
quote from a Iunilius Flagrus‚ whom scholars usually identisy with the
Iunius Philargyrius of the commentary on the EclogueS. And the
notes of Iunilius Flagrus very often² coincide with those of the anony-
mous commentary on the GeorgicS. The argument is not conclusive.
sor it assumes on the one hand that Iunilius Flagrus is a corruption of
the name Iunius Philargyrius, and on the other that the coincidence of
the notes attributed to Flagrus in the Berne scholia with those which
have hitherto been assigned to Philargyrius proves unity os authorship,
whereas it need prove no more than unity of origin. Still the facts
alleged tend to establish a probability, which 1 think justifies us in still
quoting the notes in question under the name of PhilargyriuS.

The commentary itself 1s a good one, based on excellent sourceS, and
quite worthy to rank with that of Servius, The date of its compilation
is quite uncertain· , but judging from its general style and tone, I should
be disposed to think that it could not be placed later than the fourth
century ΑΛ). There is no mention in it either of Donatus or of Servius 3
but it might be rash to inser anything from this fact. It is also true
that Serviu5‚ though he mentions DonatuS, says nothing of Philargyrius
Does this prove that Philargyrius was his contemporary, or that he lived
later?

The commentaries of Servius and of Philargyrius on the Georgics
are independent of each other ς but there is plenty of evidence to show
that sor all that constitute5‚ so to speak, the backbone of their work,
for their grammar, lexicography, history, and antiquities‚ they are alike
dependent on the stores os information gathered by the scholars of
the first and the beginning os the second centuries. This could be easily

On G.1v 89, the note os ’Flagrus is different from that of Philargyrius, and on

G. η’ 565 they are independent.
As a mle, the notes in the Berne scholia give a short abstract os those in the

Philargyrian commentary, though this is not always the case.
