both works: and that in a considerable number of instances a passage
quoted in Charisius by way of illustration is also cited to illustrate the
same word in Nonius. This is the case, sor instance, with alvus, anguis,
balteus, αἠἰε, contagio, calx, caseus, frenus, forum, grex, intubus, praesepia,
panis, palumbes, penus, papaver, sexus, sibilus, sang-uis, stirps, tapete,
vulgus. It must be added that it seldom, if ever, happens that this
coincidence in the passages cited extends to more than one quotation
among several adduced.

The section of Charisius ὠθεῖτε, however, from the third book of
Nonius in three important particulam. In the first place, it does not
treat merely of the question of gender, but of other difficulties of form
as well, as of anomalies in declension, the comparison of adjectiveS, the
formation of adverbS, and the derivation of nouns; secondly‚ it is not
arranged alphabetically ; and thirdly‚ it considers differences of gender
very osten as indications of difference in meaning, while Nonius confines
himself almost entirely to the question of form. It is reasonable, then,
to infer that this Section of Charisius was drawn from some work which
dealt with anomaly in formation in a sporadic and miscellaneous way,
not by way of lists strictly drawn up in alphabetical order, or confined to
particular branches of the subject.

Proceeding now to compare this part of Charisius with the corre·
sponding parts of Priscian, we find the same kind of relation existing
between Charisius and Priscian as between Charisius and Nonius, namely,
that Priscian seemS, in contrast to CharisiuS‚ to be drawing upon a
strictly grammatical work or works. Some of the words (about fourteen,
Ῑ think) are treated by all three writers, NoniuS, Charisius, and Priscian:
these are alvus, charta, clunes, cineis, calx, crines, grex, palumbes, penus,
papaver, sexus, sal, sanguis, and stirps.

Returning‚ then, to Nonius, we find that his alphabetical arrangement,
his grammatical treatment, and the considerable number of instances
common to both writerS, suggest a close relation between his third book
and the sources of Priscian 1, pp. 169-71, and a relation of some kind,
though not nearly so close, between this book and the sources of
CharisiuS, pp. 70-109.

We know that Probus and Caper treated separately of the question
os doubtful gender (de dubiis generibus). I think it, then, extremely pro·
bable that Nonius' third book is neither more nor less than an extract from
the work of one or the other os these writerS.¹ CharisiuS‚ on the other
hand, in the section which we have been considering, was, I believe, draw-
ing either directly or indirectly upon Pliny’s books dubii sermonis. This 1
think probable, not merely from the express mention of Pliny's name, but
also from the range of the quotationS. And the coincidences between
Charisius and Nonius 1 would explain by supposing that Probus either
drew upon Pliny's treatise, which he may well have done, as he outlived
Pliny by some years, or that he used the same authorities· (Comp.
Prisc‚ 1, p. 393, Plinium et Probum.)

Before quitting this part of my subject, I would observe that there
