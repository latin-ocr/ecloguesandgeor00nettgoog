345 P. VERGILI MARole

continuoque animos volgi et trepidantia bello

Martius ille aeris rauci canor increpat, et vox

auditur fractos sonitus imitata tubarum;

tum trepidae inter se coeunt pinnisque coruscant,
spiculaque exacuunt rostris aptantque lacertos,

et circa regem atque ipsa ad praetoria densae 75-
miscentur, magnisque vocant clamoribus hostem.

ergo ubi ver nanctae sudum camposque patentiS,
erumpunt portiS, concurritur3 aethere in alto

fit sonitus; magnum mixtae glomerantur in orbem,

praecipitesque cadunt; non densior aere grand0,

77. ‘ Nanctae’ is used as a finite verb,
not as a participle, as Heyne would have

It matters little whether a verb substan-
