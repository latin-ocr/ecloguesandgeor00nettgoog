iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto,

tu modo nascenti puer0, quo ferrea primurn

desinet ac toto surget gens aurea mund0,

casta fave Lucina: tuus iarn regnat Apollo, 10
teque adeo decus hoc aevi, te consule, inibit,

Pollio, et incipient magni procedere menses;

te duce, si qua manent sceleris vestigia nostri,

inrita perpetua solvent formidine terraS.

ille deum vitam accipiet divisque videbit 15
permixtos heroas et ipse videbitur illis,

pacatumque [ege—t patriis virtutibus orbern.

7. ⁸ Nova progenieS,’ a new and better

. race of men.

‘Caelo demittitur ’ comp? G. 11 385,
‘ Necnon Ausonii Troia gens missa coloni. '

8. [‘Nascenti’: comp. Sen. ConS. Polyb.
lv 3, ‘ nascentum hominurn fletum&—
Η. Ν.] ‘ Nascenti—fave‚’ smile on or
speed his birth.

It is difficult to say whether ‘quo’ is
ablative os the agent (⁴ who shall end the
race of iron and restore the age of gold ')‚
or an ablative absolute or ablative of cir-
cumstance, like ‘ te consule'—‘under whom
the age of iron shall end,’ etc.

‘ Primum‚’ at last3 comp. 1 45.

‘ Ferrea :’ we do not know the details
os the tenfold metallic division (is such a
division existed), and so cannot tell whether
the iron age occupied the last place in it,
or whether it is simply borrowed from the
γ Hesiodic ages. Juv. xm 28 speaks os his
‘ nona aetas ' as worse than the age os iron,
[but the text is doubtful (Biicheler and
F riedlander prefer other readings), and the
phrasei if correct, means the ninth century
A.U.c. · .

10. Is any reliance- is to be placed on
Serv.'s statement (quoted on v. 4), that

- the Sibylline prophecy made the last os'*

the ten ages the age os the sun, it is doubt·
less he that is spoken of here as Apollo.
The secle os the Sun is going on ς and
when that is over, the new cycle will suc·
ceed. Whether any further histoflcal re·
ference is supposed—to Apollo as the
reputed father of Octavian, sor instance,
mu‘st depend on the opinion held as to
the hero of the Eclogue.
‘ Tuus‚’ because Lucina and Diana
(Eilithyia and Artemis) were identified.
11. ‘ Tuque adeo ’ are not unsrequently
found together, as in G. 1 243 EnniuS,

Medea, fr. 14, ⁶ Iuppiter, tuque adeo,
summe sol, qui omnis res inspicis 3 ’ ‘ adeo'
here as elsewhere gives rhetorical pro·
minence to the word aster which it is used.
See G. 11 323, ιν 197, Α. 111 203. .

‘ Decus hoc aevi,' this glorious age.
Lucr. 11 15, ‘Qualibus in tenebris vitae
quantisque periclis Degitur hoc aevi quod·
cumque est.’ Comp. ⁸ monstrum mu·
lieris‚' Plaut. Poen. 1 ii 64, and δεσπότου
στύγος, Aesch. Choeph. 770. [Or the
words may mean ‘this glory os the a'ge.’] ”

⁶ Inibit, ’ commence, asin ‘anno ineunte,’
‘ ineunte aetate.'

12. [‘ Pollio :² some ed. substitute ‘ or-
bis ’ quite arbitrarily. See Introd. p. 22]

‘Magni menses,’ the periods into which
the ‘ magnus annus ' was divided.

13. ‘ T e duce,’ under your auspices as
consul, giving the year its name.

‘ Sceleris,' not general, like ‘fraudis,’
v. 31, but referring to the guilt -of civil
bloodshed. Keightley refers to Hor. Od.
1 ii 29, ‘Cui dabit partis scelus expiandi
Iuppiter? and Epod. vu 1, ‘ Qu0, quo
scelesti ruitis ?’ So ‘ pacatum orbem ' v. 17.

14. ‘ Inrita,’ in its strict sense, by their
abolition.

15. ‘ Ille,’ the ⁴ uer ’ of v. 8. [‘ Acci·
piet ' may mean ‘ shall be initiated into‚’
on theanalogy os ‘ accipere sacra.'—H. Ν.]
‘ Deum vitam,' characteristic ps the olden
ῗῗῖἶ Ϊῖἔῗιιξῖῗῑῑῖξῖἶῖὗῑιὲἶῗῗνάἐε mliii}

⁸intercourse with the gods on earth (Catull.

an' ad ἦα), here expressed b ‘ videbit.’
16. ‘ Videbitur’ expresse-s t e recipro-
cal character of the intimacy. -In Aesch. ,
Eum. 411 the F uries are. said to be οὔτ’
ἐν θεαῖσι πρὸς θεῶν ὁρω ’ αις.
17. ‘Patriis'cannot¹ explained with·
eut solving the riddlebf the Eclogue.
