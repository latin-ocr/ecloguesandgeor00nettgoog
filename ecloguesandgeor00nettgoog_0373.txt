‘ Solemque potentem ε ’ comp. 1 92,
‘ rapidive potentia solis.’ We may render
‘ oppressi-ee ' or ‘ tyrannous.’

374. ‘Uriz' the ‘urus’ was properly
a wild animal mentioned by Caesar (B.
G. vl 28) and Pliny (vul 38) as a native
of the Hercynian forest in Germany. Here
and 111 532 the name is applied to the
buffaloes of Italy.

‘ Capreae ' Pa1.‚ Verona fragm.. Gud.,
and Rom.(which has ‘ capraeae ²). ‘ Caprae '
Med.‚ which Wagn. prefers, partly from
a mistaken notion of its superior authority.
lle comp. E. 11 64, ‘ Florentem cytisum
sequitur lasciva capella.' But it seems
more like Virg- to keep the goat, the arch-
offender, to the last (v. 380), and then to
indicate his crime rather than mention it
plainly, at the same time that the descrip-
tion of his punishment and the attendant
circumstances keeps him prominently be-
fore the reader’s mind. See notes on 111
237, E. vl 29. For the fondness of roes
for vines, comp. Hor. S. ιι iv 43, ‘ Vinea
summittit capreas non semper edulis!

‘Sequaces' means persecuting, at the
same time that it seems to give a picture
οὗ the deer climbing even the rocks after
t e vine.

375. ‘ Inludunt,’ disport themselves
with it. ‘ Pascuntur,' etc. ε the commen-
tators repeat ‘ quam ' from ‘ cui.’ But the
passage is probably parallel to vv. 207,
208 (note); the only difference is the
absence of the conjunction here.

376. Comp. Lucr. 11120, ‘nix acri con·
creta pruina.' Virg. in borrowing the
expression has awkwardly changed ‘nix’
into ‘frigora,' which can hardly be said to
be congealed by frost. ‘ No cold that
hoar frost ever congealed, no summer that
ever smote heavily on the parching rocks,
has beenso fatal toit as the herdS, and the

venom of their sharp moth, and the wound
impressed on the stem that they have
gnawed to the quick.‘

377. ‘ Scopulis ε ’ the vineyards on the
terraced rocks. So v. 522, ‘Mitis in
apricis coquitur vindemia saxis.’

378. ‘Illi' seems to be dative after
‘ nocuere,' not nom. with ‘greges’

‘Venenum dentis :' comp. v. 196,
⁴ urentis culta capellas.’

379. ‘Admorso ' Serv. and Gud. Vari-
ants are ⁶ admorsum’ (pat), ‘admorsu'
(Rom), ‘amorso' (Med ), ‘amorsu’ (Med.
corr.) ε Ribbeck reads ‘ ad morsum.’
There can be no question that ‘ admorso ’
is right, the termination (as Heyne sug·
gests) having probably been altered by
copyists who found a difficulty in the
gelgssiirpsss as used by Virg.‚ is masc. in
its literal, fem. in its transferred sense.
[See Fest. p. 313, and Non. p. 226, who
show that t e ancient writers were not so
strict.—H. N.] ,

380. For the custom, see Varro, R. R.
1 2, and Ovid's translation of the well·
known lines of EvenuS, F. 1 353. The
reason assigned is probably fictitious, as
appears from the fact that the goat, though
it gnawed the olive, was especially for-
bidden to be offered to Pallas.

‘ Omnibus ari8,’ as we should say, uni-
versally.

381. ‘Et' couples it clause with the
verbal only, not with the adverbial part
of the clause preceding.

‘ Proscaenia,'2rpoc5xt'1vtov, is the same as
λογεῖον, or stage 3 σκηνὴ being the scene.

382. Heyne, to carry ‘non aliam ob
culpam ’ through the sentence and pre-
serve the continuity, takes ‘praemia to
be in appositior] to ‘ caprum ’ understood.
This is too artificial: the words ‘ veteres
ineunt proscaenia ludi’ intervene, and a
digression is inevitable at v, 385. At the
