BUCOLICA. ECL. IV.

iam legere et quae sit poteris cognoscere virtuS,
molli paulatim flavescet campus arista,
incultisque rubens pendebit sentibus uva,

et durae quercus sudabunt roscida mella.

pauca tamen suberunt priscae vestigia fraudis,

quae temptare Thetim ratibus, quae cingere muris
oppida, quae iubeant telluri infindere sulcos,

alter erit turn Tiphys, et altera quae vehat Argo
delectos heroas; erunt etiam altera bella, 35

is doubtless the true reading: ‘ paren·
tum,' Rom., Gud. (corrected), would be a
natural correction from such passages as
A. 1 645, 11448, x 282. The child will
read of the lories of its father and the
heroes of ol er time, subjects of poetry
and history, and thus leam to conceive
of virtue.

28. ‘ Flavescet arista,’ that is, spon·
taneously, which seems to be expressed
by ‘ paulatim.' There will be no process
of sowing, from which the springing of the
{roplcan flate, but theC field willll gradsslssffiy

xv1 43 soll. (of the Islands os the Blest):
‘ Reddit ubi Cererem tellus inarata quot-
annis», Et imputata floret usque vinea,
Glerminat et nunquam fallentis termes
o ivae.’

‘ Molli ’ seems to include the notions
of flexibility (comp. v 31) and delicacy.
The corn-ear may of course be looked
upon as rough, ‘horrens3' but it may
also suggest an opposite notion, with no
less truth. To suppose with some of the
commentators that the corn of the golden
age is to be no longer pointed and bearded,
but soft, is, 1 think, to mistake the poetical
ιωξξῗοῐη G. 1· 132 Virg. goes one step
further, intimating that in the golden age
wine ran in the beds of the rivers.
ιῂέῗῂοῃῗῗῗέἱῗᾍ Ἷῖῗέῗῗαξξεῗῗ affixi}
wa's gathered by bees from leavoe, ⁶ aerii
mellis caelestia dona,' G. 1v 1. On the
return of the golden age it will appear in
la er quantities ς men will be able to
gal-{er it from leaves for themselves, as they
will obtain every thi else without labour.
Comp. G. 1 131. here also may be a
reference, as Heyne remarks, to the honey
sometimes found in the hollows of trees
(G. 11' 453), as there is in the parallel

passage, Hor. Epod. xvt 47, ‘ Mella cava
manant ex ilice,’ as if this would happen
everywhere under the new order of thin 3
and this is supported by Hesiod, Wor s,
232 foll„ οὔρεσι δὲ δρῦς Ακρη ν τε φέρει
βαλάνους, μέσση δὲ μελίσσας, o the golden-
age blessings which attend the good even
now.

3¹· ‘ FraudiS,' the wickedness of arti-
ficial society, opposed to the innocence of
the state of nature. The idea is kept in
⁶ temptare ’ and in ‘ mentiri ' (v. 42).

32. ‘Temptare' like ‘ sollicitant freta,'
G. 11 503. Comp. Hor. Od. 1 iii 9 soll.

‘Cingere,’ imitated by Ov. Μ. 1 97
(speaking of the golden age), ‘ Nondum

raecipites cin ebant oppida fossae.'
‘ Thetin ’ Rom.

33. ‘ Infindunt pariter ·sulcos,’ A. v
142. Rom. has ‘tellurem infindere su100.'
The necessity of ploughing was among the
marks of transition from the golden to
the silver age (G. 1 122, 125, 134), and its
continued practice is a proof that the re·
generation of things is still incomplete.
Comparing this line with v. 28, we must
suppose that though corn grows spon-
taneously‚ rnen are eedy sor more, and
try to extort more y cultivation. See
v. 40.

34. In the Sibylline cyele all history
was to come over again. Virg. seems to
be mixing this notion with that of a return
to the age of gold, so as to give some
{ifffessssdstzfissfflssgz} ἐξὲξ Σῖοῗιῖιῗέἷὲ·
between brazen and iron. Tiphys was
helmsman of the Argo.

‘ Altera bella,’ the old wars over again.
