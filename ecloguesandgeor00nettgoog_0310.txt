295. ‘ Must ' was boiled down to ‘ eare-
num’ (Pallad.), ‘defrutum ’ (lv 269), or
‘ savss on anight when there was no moon.

⁴ olcanus, as Cerda remarkS, is used
elsewhere of a large fire, such as would be
required for boiling ‘ must ' (Col. xn 193
G. lv 269, ‘ igni multo ’).

This hypermeter seems a fair instance
of a metrical anomaly introduced for
descriptive effect. See v, 482 ; 11 69.

296. ‘ Foliis‚’ vine leaves3 wood was
apt to give a smoky taste to the liquor.

‘ Undarn aheni like ‘undantis aheni,'
A. vn 263. Col. ΧΠ 20 says that the
vaesel should be of lead, as brass was
liable to rust in boiling.

For ‘ trepidi ⁹ Pal. originall gave ‘ te·

idi‚’ which could scarcely used of
goiling liquid. Med. Rom. have ‘tre idis.’

[‘ Aeni ’ Med„ Pal„ Gud. , but Ge 1. 113
says that the best MSS. in his time read
‘ aheni.'—-H. N.]

297. ‘ Rubicun a Ceres,' v. 96. Col.
11 21 says that corn should be reaped
‘ cum rubicundum colorem traxerunt.'

‘ Medio aestu ’ wou-ld most naturally
mean midday, as in 111 331, lv 401. In
that case however we must suppose a
strange piece of ignorance on Virg. s part,
midday being recisel the time which
the reaper wou d avoi , though it is the
time for threshing. Comp. Theocr. x 49:

Σῖτον {horti-”swas φεύγειν τὸ μεσαμβρινὸν
πνον·

'13ae εαλλάμας ἄχυρον τελέθει τημόςδε μά-
tara.

Ἀρχεσθαι δ’ ἀ &vr-uc ὄγειρομένω κορυδαλλῶ,
Καὶ λήγειν domoc· ἐλινῦσαι δὲ τὸ καῦμα.

‘ Aestu ’ then had better be taken of sum·
mer as the hot season, as ‘ frigoribus

mediis,' E. x 65, means midwinter.
Wagn. objects that the information in
that case would be so obvious as to be
needless. But Virg. is speaking os the
operations proper to the various seasons
(as the next lines show) as well as of the
times when they should be performed, and
‘hiberni,' v. 291, preparaeus for the men-
tion of summer. Wagn.'s own view, that
‘ medio aestu ' means generally a summer’s
day as contrasted with a winter’s night,
without special reference to neon, makes
‘ medio ' a worse than useless epithet.

‘ Succiditur’ seems not to specify any
thing about the manner os cutting, merely
implying that the thing is severed from
below. ‘Flos succisus aratro,’ A. tx

298. ‘ Tostas ’ not with ‘aestu.’

299. ⁸ Ploughing and sowing both be-
long to the warm months,'—spring and
autumn.

‘ Nudu5,' without the upper garment,
as Cincinnatus was found ploughing by
the messenger from the Senate, Livy 111
26. Here and in the following lines
Virg. imitates Hes· Works 493 foll. ς the
precept is from Hes. Works 391, γυμνὸν
σπείρειν, γυμνὸν δὲ βοωτεῖν. Serv. has a
story, mentioned also by SuetoniuS, that
some one, a parently in Virg.'s lifetime‚
hearing the t part os the line repeated,
completed it with the words ‘ habebis
frigore febrem.’

⁸ Colono ’ seems to be intended strictly
with reference to the labours of cultivation,
as other works for winter follow, v. 305.
