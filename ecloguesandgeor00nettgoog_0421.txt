hoc satis armentis: superat pars altera curae,
lanigeros agitare greges hirtasque capellas.

Castaliam molli devertitur orbita clivo,

285. ⁴ circumvectamur' may either be
an image from chamot-driving, as just
below, v. 291, 01 110111 sailing, as in 11 41
soll. ‘ Capti amore,' E. Vl 10.

[so 11 195. xv 395·]

287. ‘ Agitare ' looks almost like a play
on the word, intended to apply bot to
the breeder and to the agricultural t.
If it must be confined to one, it will to
the breeder‚ as the next line shows.

288. Α5 1151121, 110 (1005 1101 extenuate
the difficulty, but tells them that they
can co with it, and points to the glory.
See 1 3, 11 37. He goes on to say that
his own feeling is the same: he knows
the effort needed, but yearns for the
exertion and looks to the reward.

289-293. These lines are a brief imita-
tion of Lucr. 1 136 1011. and 921 foll.:
see also v 97 foll.

289. ‘Animi dubius 1 ’ 50 Lucr. ‘animi
sallit‚’ which Virg. perhaps thought too
bold3 in A. ιν 96 110 copies the phrase,
but changes ‘animi' into ‘ade0. See
note on A. Vl 332 [and cxx. in Roby
5 1321, Munro Lucr. 1 136].

‘ Vincere verbis ’ 15 110111 Lucr. (v 735),
who however has a different meaning,
‘ to prove,’ whereas Virg. must mean to
triumph over the difficulties 01 the subject,
with some such reference as v. 9.

293. ‘Molli clivo,’ Ε. tx 8, here of

1211211 spring. In both passages there is
a contrast between ‘iugum ' and ‘mollis
clivus!

‘ Devertitur ' seemingly 1125115 ordinary
sense 01 turning aside. Virg. gets to the
spring, but by 2 path of his own making.
This 2550111011 01 originality is the common
boast of Roman poets, who constantly
claim honours for having been the first to
imitate Greek subjects.

294-321. ‘ Through the winter months
keep the sheep in sheds, well laid with
straw and fern. The goats should have
arbutes and fresh water 3 their cotes should
face the south. They require and deserve
as much care at these times as sheep;
hair is not so valuable as wool, but it has
its use; and besideS, they are more pro-
lifie and give more milk: generally too
they need less tendance—another reason
for not grudging it when wanted.’

294. ‘Awake 2 louder and 2 1011101·
5112111.’ Such invocations are common
where the task 15 supposed to increase in
difficulty, e.g. A. vn 37, before the de-
scription of the war in Italy, 111. 640,
before the catalogue 01 1110 11211211 101005.
Here it is perhaps open to the objection
that a deliberate exaggeration is intended,
the exaltation of what is naturally mean,
not the treatment of things unusually
noble in language transcending the poet’s
ordinary powers.

With ‘ma no ore sonandum' Forb.
comp. Hor. . 1 iv 43, ‘os Magna sona·
turum‚' one 01 1110 qualifications of the
poet—probably 211 imitation of Virg.

295. ‘Incipiens . . . edico’maybean
allusion to the edict made by the raetors
on entering office, as Keightley 0 erves,
remarking also that the language in gene-
ral seems to be that 01 2 proprietor going
