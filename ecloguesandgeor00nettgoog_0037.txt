VIRGIL AND HIS ANCIENT CRITICS. xxxiii

ΙΙ.

But it was remarked not only that Virgil ventured on new combina-
tions of words, but that he invented new words. Here, again, it is

perhaps allowable to start from the previously-quoted passage in the
Ars Poetica (vv. 48 foll) ε

‘ Si sorte necesse est
indiciis monstrare recentibus abdita rerum,
fingere cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis
continget, dabiturque licentia sumpta pudenter,
et nova fictaque nuper habebunt verba fidem, si
Graeco fonte cadant, parce detorta. quid autern?
Caecilio Plautoque dabit RomanuS‚ ademptum
Vergilio Varioffiue Ρ ego cur, acquirere pauca
si possum, invi eor, cum lingua Catonis et Enni
sermonem patrium ditaverit, et nova rerum
nomina protulerit ?'

Here Virgil is mentioned by name, and it is distinctly implied that
he was attacked for the invention of new wordS. Horace says that words
lately coined will pass current if derived, with sparing alteration, from a
Greek source. Ι am not sure that I clearly understand what this
meanS. But that Virgil was attacked for his use of Greek words is clear
from Macrobius 1 xxiv 7, ‘ si . . mille alia multum pudenda seu in verbis
modo Graecis modo barbariS, seu in ipsa dispositione operis depre-
henderentur.' Compare v xvii 15, ‘ postremo Graecae linguae quam se
libenter addixerit de crebris quae usurpat vocabulis aestimate :² and the
critic mentions dius, daedala, trieterica, choreas, hyalus‚ and some
otherS, concluding thuS, after noticing the poet's predilection for Greek
inflections‚ ‘ denique omnia carmina sua Graece maluit inscribere,
Bucolica Georgica Aeneis, cuius nominis figuratio a regula Latinitatis
aliena est)

In the sixth book of the Saturnalia (tv 17) Virgil is defended for this
proceeding by the argument that other writers had used Greek words
before him: ‘inseruit operi suo et Graeca verba, sed non primus hoc
ausus! Lychni, aethra, daedalus, reboant are then justified by the
example of older poets; and the critic remarks ‘ sed hac licentia largius
usi sunt veteres, parcius Maro: quippe illi dixerunt et pausam et
machaeram et asotiam et malacen et alia similia.' This is Horace's
argument: why should not Virgil and Varius be allowed what was not
forbidden to CaeciliuS, PlautuS, Ennius and Cato?

But Virgil (Macrobius ι xxiv 7) was charged also with using bar-
barian, that is, non-Latin words. There is a very short answer to this in
the sixth book of the Saturnalia (lv 2 3) ‘ necnon et Punicis Oscisque
verbis usi sunt veteres: quorum imitatione Vergilius peregrina verba non
respuit! The instances given are zer-us, ‘ Gallica vox qua feri boves
significantur,' and camurus. On urus Servius on Georg. 11 374 says
‘ silvestres uri, i.e. boves agresteS, qui in Pyrenaeo monte nascuntur,
inter Gallias et Hispanias posit0.' On camurus Macrobius has virtually
the same note as Servius and Philargyrius on Georg. 111 55, and is
probably therefore drawing upon the same source, which I hope to show

I. C
