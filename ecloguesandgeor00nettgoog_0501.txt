the legend. When‘ Virg. came to the
composition of the Aeneid, he seems to
have seen the necessity of being more
explicit,·though even there his narrative
{a.{31fl{¹.‘;¹⁶3}¹l1..illsssffflbvlss‘f‘thsszi 3533ss
os narration is more rapid, tells the whole
³‘037f‘2mrssg‘2312‘3 ¹323&ss ¹A50¹321'·3222 ³
‘leges ’ and ‘ foedera' are coupled G. 1
60. Again we are left to collect from the
context that Orpheus was specially ordered
not to look back. The injunction‚ as
Cerda remarks, seems to be one of the
same kind as that mentioned E. vlu 102.

488. ‘ Dementia cepit,' E. 11 69, vl 47.
Rom. and others have ‘ subit0.’

489. ‘ Manes : ’ see v. 505.

490. Serv. connects ‘ iarn with ‘suam,’
and this Wagn. would approve but sor
the injury to the rhythm. But all that
could be gained from it may be extracted
from the passage as it stands, where
‘suam ⁹ is emphatic, ‘he looked back on
his recovered Eurydice, just as daylight
was actually upon them.’

491. ‘vietus animi,’ like ‘animi du·
bius,’ ιιι 289. See A. ιι 61, vr 332, and
Munro‘Lucr. 1 136. ‘yictuSJapparently
me⁴a9n²s ‘nsshumsssztelhfigiklssslilke ‘ incassum

‘effudit curaa'Juv. x 78, tho h that is

· ‘ Tyranni: ’ there is perhaps no passage

there is plainly no invidious connotation,
[A. lv 320, vu 266, 342, x 448, and
perhaps x1175. In A. 1361, vul 483 and
perhaps here the bad sense suitS, and Con.

Par. Lost, 1x 782: ‘ Earth felt the wound,
and Nature from her seat Sighing through
all her works gave signs os woe, ‘sbat all

Original.’ Serv. has a curious notion that ,

the sound was one of joy among the
shadoe, and quotes a passage from Luean’s
lost Orpheus, ‘ gaudent a luce relictam
(Heyne conjectures ‘ reductam’ or ‘re-
vectam,' but ‘a luce relictam ’ may =
‘luce carentem ³) Eurydicen iterum spe·
rantes Orphea, Manes.’ Voss’s opinion
that the sound is occasioned by the force
exerted to bring Eurydice back would
spoil the poetry of the passage.

‘Avernis' (Med. and Serv.) is adj. as
A. vr 118. Vnt.. Rom„ Gud„ and some
MSS. os Serv. have ‘Avemi,’ accepted
by Ribbeck. Rom. has also ‘ stagni est.'

494. [Med. writes ‘perdeditss and so
formerly Ribbeck.—H. N.]

f495‘iggFuror' is the ‘ subita dementia’
o v, .

We need not take ‘iterum’ in the
sense os ⁶ rursuS‚’ as Forb. thinks, It is
true that the Fates were not calling Eury·
dice a second time ⁸ retr0‚’ but they were
calling her a second time, and there is
nothing strange in supposing Virg. to have
combined two forms of expression, ‘ vo·
cant retro' and ‘ vocant iterum.'
