44. ‘ Et saciet '
ducet‚’ as we should say, ⁶ and she shall do
so.' So ‘ ni faciat,' A. 1 62, is equivalent
to ‘ ni molliat et temperet.’ Observe how
Virg. throughout this line has varied the
expressions of Theocr., his Corydon being
more courteous, and his Alex1s presum-
ably more sensitive. The fact has been
already noticed in part by Serv.

45-55. ‘ Come and enjoy a country life.
Nature produces her loveliest flowers—
all for you3 and you shall have the
fairest and most delicious fruits.’ Spohn
rightly remarks that the general scope of
the pas e is simply an invitation to
share the elights of the country, Corydon
representi the nym hs and himself as
doing the onours ; ut this does not
exclude the notion os special presents
of flowers and fruit like those in 111
70. With the expression comp. G. 11 3
note.

45. [‘ Formonse' Pal. Rom—H. N.]

46. The nymphs offer flowers, being
goddesses of the springs that water them,
as Voss remarks, comparing pseudo-
Virg. Copa 15, ‘ Et quae virgineo libata
Achelois ab amne Lilia vimmeis attulit
in calathis‚' evidently from the context
an imitation os the present p e. He
may be right also in saying that orydon

mella's reference to this passage in his
tenth book, on the cultivation of a garden.
[Paul. p. 47, says ⁶ calathos Graeci, nos
dicimus quas-illos ἐ so Serv. here, evi-
dently drawing directly or indirectly on
Verrius Flaccus—H. N.]

47.] ‘ Pallentis violas’ [yellow pansies
or wallflowersL λευκὸἰον. ‘ Tinctus viola
pallor amantium‚’ Hor. od. 111 x 14.
Heyne remarks that the paleness of

equivalent to ‘ et ab·

southerns is yellow. Ov. M. xl 100 has
‘ saxum palluit auro.'

48. ‘ Anethum τ’ an aromatic plant
with a yellow flower, akin to fennel 3 it is
grown in our gardens. In a celebrated
p e of Moschus (Idyl 111 101) it is
call τό τ’ εὐθαλὲς οὖλον ἄνηθον.

49. ‘ Casia z ' an aromatic shrub, with
leaves like the olive, common in the south
of Europe. ⁶ Intexens casia (vaccinia),’ a
poetical variety sor ‘ intexens casiam.'

50. ‘ Vaccinia,’ v. 18. It is not clear
whether ⁸ calta ² is the nthemum or
the marigold. That its fragrance was not
its recommendation appears from Pliny
(xxx 28), where its ‘ gravis odor' is men·
tioned, ancl Ovid (Pont. 11 iv 28), who
enumerates among other changes in the
course of nature, ‘ Caltaque Paestanas
vincet odore rosa5.'' [⁸ Calta ’ Pal. Gud.:
‘ caltha ’ Rom-H. N.]

‘ Pingit,’ picks out, the hyacinth (Ρ)
bei as it were the ground which is varie-
gatgg by the ⁶ calta.

51. A description of quinces‚ which
were called ‘ mala Cydonia.’ These fruits
have noth' to do with mak‘ a garland,
as some of t e commentators t ink. The

‘ &uic quoque pomo‚’ i.e. ‘ prunis ς '

‘ Honos erit’ ι ‘ iate dilectum fuerit:

Some inferior MSS. and the old editions
