indicio est tractu surgens oleaster eodem

plurimus et strati bacis silvestribus agri.

at quae pinguis humus dulcique uligine laeta,
quique frequens herbis et fertilis ubere campus— 185
qualem saepe cava montis convalle solemus
despicere; huc summis liquuntur rupibus amneS,
felicemque trahunt limum-quique editus austr0,

et filicem curvis invisam pascit aratris:

hic tibi praevalidas olim multoque fluentis
sufficiet Baccho vitis, hic fertilis uvae,

190

hic laticis, qualem pateris libamus et auro,

182. The presence of the wild olive
shows that the soil is good sor the culti-
vated olive. The ‘oleaster,' as Martyn
remarked, is not to be consounded with
the plant cultivated in our gardens under
that name, which is properly called
⁸ elaeagnus'

183. with the picture comp. E. vu 54.
‘ Silvestribus' here is used strictly, opp.
to ‘felicibus‘

184-194. ⁸ A rich and moist slope, with
a southern aspect, is the soil sor vmes.'

184. ‘Dulci uligine: ’ Col. 11 9 says,
‘ solet autem salsam nonnunquam et anm·
ram uliginem vomere terra, quae quamvis
matura iam sata, manante noxio umore,
ῗᾚῒῗέρὲῖζῑςο 3¹1¹. ’ᾖξ’ εἷςίἶὲέιῖγξῗὲῃέῗέξ
near a spring.

185. ‘ Frequens herbis ε ’ comp. Ov.
Her. XVI 54, ‘locus piceis ilicibusque sre-
quens ; ’ Tac. A. 1v 65,- ‘quod talis silvae
frequens secundusque esset) ‘ Ubere’
seems to be merely a metaphor from the
breast as the source of nounshment.

186, 187. ‘ Such as we osten see at the
bottom (or on the side) os a mountain
hollow.’ Heyne [and Ribbeck1, following
Heius„ read ‘dispicere ’ from Gud. etc.
See A. 1 224.

187. ‘ Huc ’ is used where in a regularly
constructed sentence we should expect
‘ quo! The sentence gives the reason sor
the molsture os land so placed.

‘ Liquuntur’ is constructe-d like ⁴ fluunt,'
as in Stat. Theb. v 618, ‘in volnera
liquitur imber‚' comp. by F orb. [‘ Lin-
quuntur' Pal.—H. N.]

188. ‘ Felicem limum ' forms a contrast
to ‘tenuis argilla)

‘ Quique editus austro ' is to be coupled
with ‘quique frequens herbis,’ not ex·

plained with Heyne‚ ‘aut qualem eum
cam um videmus, qui editus austro.'

‘ itus austr0‚' rising to the south.
‘ Editus’ is not = ‘ exposituS,' but has its
natural signification 3 ‘austro ’ (dat.) nearly
= ‘ ad austrum.’ Comp. sor the expres-
sion ‘caelo educere,’ A. 11 186 ; sor the
sense Col. 111 1, ‘optimum est solum nec
campestre nec praeceps, simile tamen
edito campo,'and 111 2, ‘vinum . . . iu·
cundius adferunt collina quae magis ex-
uberant aquiloni prona, sed sunt gene-
rosiora sub austro· In the latter assage
¹ aquiloni prona ' also illustrates t e con·
struction of ‘editus austr0.' Authorities
were divided as to the best aspect sor a
vineyard ; see v. 298.

189. ‘ Filicern,’ the female seru or brake
(Martyn). Some early editors read ‘sili-
cem,' which would agree with Col. 111 11.
But ‘ filicem ’ is the reading of the MSS. ,
is supported by Pliny xvn 29, and suits
‘ pascit ' better.

190. ⁸ Fluentis : ’
100.

191. ‘ Fertilis uvae’ like ‘Fertilis fru-
gum pecorisque‚’ Hor. Carm. Saec. 29,
εἷς. ἱ] ἕετξί1ἱ3,’ like ‘ serax‚’ being the verbal
o ‘ ero.

192. ‘ Pateris et aur0.’ There seems
no objection to explaining this and similar
expressions (if it can be called explana·
tion) by what is termed Hendiadys, so
long as we bear in mind that such figures
are not rules which poets followed, but
helps devised by grammarians for classify·
ing varieties oslanguage. The word Hen-
diadyS, indeed, amounts merely to a state·
ment of the fact that two words are used
to express one thing. We might bave had
either ‘ pateris ’ or ‘ auro ’ separately ; the
poet chooses to use both. Such redun-
