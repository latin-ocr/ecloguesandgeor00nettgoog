INTRODUCTION. 21

of cadence than his latest. In any case there can be no justi-
fication for resorting, as Ribbeck has done, to the hypothesis of
interpolations on the one hand, and lacunae on the other. It is
the trustworthiness of the MSS. that has preserved to us proofs
os symmetry which had been overlooked for centurieS, as in
Eclogues V and V111. Surely their authority is to be equally re-
spected where they refuse to disclose any such proofS, especially
when the two classes of cases are seen to be separated by an
intelligible line—J. C.

DATEs OF THE EcLoousss.

It is not possible to decide with certainty the date either of
the composition of each Eclogue, or of the publication of the
whole work. Virgil himself, at the end of the fourth Georgic,
speaks of the Eclogues generally as the work of his youth, and
this agrees with the statement of Asconius (quoted by Probus and
Servius¹) that ‘ XXVIII annos natum bucolica edidisse ' (42 B.C.).

The Eclogues themselves do not offer very much in the way
of interna] evidence. If the fifth Eclogue refers to Julius Caesar,
it may be assigned to the year 43 or 42 B.C. In any case there
is no doubt that the second and third are earlier than the fisth,
and the fifth again than the ninth. The ninth cannot on any
hypothesis be dated later than the year 40, and 1 have attempted
to show in an excursus on this poem that it was written before
the first, and immediately after the territoria] confiscations of 41
B.C. The first cannot have been written earlier than the year
40, and may have received its finishing touches later. Virgil
speaks there not only of the restoration of his farm, but of altars
which he has erected in honour of Octavian (v. 43). Divine honours
were not, so far as we know, publicly decreed to Octavian by
the towns of Italy until 36 B.C. (Appian V 132). It is uncertain
'whether the language of the first Eclogue warrants us in inserting
that they were paid to him by private individuals before this date,
or whether the verses in question were added by Virgil as late as
36, or whether the whole poem should be assigned to this year.
