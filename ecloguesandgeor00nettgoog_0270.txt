book we see glimpses of the same unflinching resolution ε

‘ terram multo ante memento
excoquere, et magnos scrobibus concedere montis.’

‘ Seminibus positis, superest diducere terram
saepius ad capita, et duros iactare bidentis,
aut presso exercere solum sub vomere, et apsa

The ploughing is to be acrOSS, as well as up and down3the lines
of vines». The bullocks may be restiff: the turns may be sharp
and awkward: but the work is to be done. So when he passes
from the vine, the olive, and the apple and its cognateS, to less

a mean subject in the language of poetry: but it is labour still,
and it is the effort required that makes him love it. In =the
Fourth Book, it must be confessed, there seem to be feW, if any,
touches of this feeling. Yet some may perhaps be inclined to
