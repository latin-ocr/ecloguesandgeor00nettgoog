PRIMA Syracosio dignata est ludere versu

nostra nec erubuit silvas habitare Thalea.

curn canerem reges et proelia, Cynthius aurem

vellit, et admonuit: ‘Pastorem, Tityre, pinguis
pascere oportet oviS, deductum dicere carmen.' 5
nunc ego—namque super tibi erunt, qui dicere laudes,

1-12. ‘1 was venturing out of my pas·
toral strains into heroic song when A llo
warned me back. 1 will write you t en a
rural poem, VaruS, and leave the celebra-
tion of your deeds to others; yet even a
rural theme, Itrust, will suffice to preserve
your memory.

1. ‘ Prima ’ is explained by the Verona
scholia either of Virg.'s claim to be the first

uent attempts. Of the tw0, the latter is
oubtless recommended by the context3

said by some to have been the ingen-tress

to write on Roman history, but found the
subject not to his liking; Serv. that his 1
subject was to have been the exploits .

4NXIV'1rg is Tityrus again, as in E. 1.
‘ Pinguis is a predicate, like ‘ deductum,'
‘ His sheep should be sat, but his verses
slender,' at the same time that ⁴ pinguis
pascere ’ are to be taken together 3 ‘ pas-
cere ut pinguescant,' as SerV. explains it.
The antithesiS, which is perhaps inten-
tionally grotesque, may be compared with
Hor. S. 11 vi 14, ‘ Pingue pecus domino
facias, et cetera praeter Ingenium.'

[Comp. also Quint. 11 x 6.—H. N.]

sion praised by guigf— ,EQ--.Vm 2, as

‘Pedum '). [‘Thalea,' Pal„ Rom„ Ver„
followed by Ribbeck. ‘Thalia,’ SerV.
and the cursive MSS.]

tional expression for epic or heroic

Comp. A. vu 41. It would include
contemporary subjects (see Hor. Ep. 11 i
251 solt), but not directly specify them,
though vv. 6, 7 show that Varus wished
Vfixlg. to write of the civil or foreign wars

‘ Aurem vellit t ¹ was a symbolical way
of reminding him of a thing, t-h-g-eaiffeing
regarded as the seat os memory. , enee
it was the established mode os ‘ antestatio,’
or summoning a witness (Hor. S. 1 ix 77 ς
ΡΙίη. κι 251), when ‚it was accompanied
with the words ‘ memento quod tu mihi in

illa causa testis eris.’ The action is repre-

-sented on coins with the word όνευε.

there may have been a connexion between
the two in Virg.'s mind, as'there would
seem to have been in the mind of Proper-

men tenuatum ’ os his Alexandrian masterS,
the ‘ exactus tenui pumice versu5‚’ with the
strains appro riate to heroic poetry. See
