o the matters actu y treated in the
Georgics, though the subject οἱ Books 1
and 11 are indicated poetically rather than
sully described.

1. This division of the subjects of Book
1 seems taken from the title of Hesiod’s
poem, Ἔργα καὶ Ἡμέραι (SerV.). So 11 1,
· Hactenus arvorum cultus et sidera caeli.’

⁸ Laetae segetes ' was a common expres-
sion; Cic. de Or. 111 38, ‘ gemmare vites»,
luxuriem esse in herbis, laetas segetes
etiam rustici dicunt,’ where it is instanced
as 3 metaphor. Keightley thinks that the
physical sense of ⁸ laetus ' was the primary
Spe, 311εὲ th? ikwtas ullincgttmnsmoed 13

emm ; so etes , owasser,an
others z SerV. refers to ‘lagtamenss manureJ.

It is not easy to determine whether
‘ etes ' refers to land, or corn. Colu-
mel a (11 15) has ‘ segetes laetas excitare,’
which ints to the corn: but a sew lines
above e uses ‘ segetem ’ unmistakably of
⁵ the field where the corn is to be sown.
‘ Laetas ’ would apply equally to both
(vv. 101, 102).

‘ Quo sidere' like ‘quo signo‚' v. 354.
Addison (Essay on the Georgics prefixed
to Dryden's translation) says that ⁸ Virgil,
to deviate from the common form of
wordS, would not make use of “ tem·
pore,'' but ‘⁶ sidere: ” ’ but the stars enter
prominently into Virg.’s lan, constituting
the shepherd’s calendar vv. 204 soll.).

2. ‘ Vertere terram’ as in v. 147,
where ‘serro’ is added.
mere glaebas,’ Lucr. 1 211.

‘ Vertentes vo-
‘ Vertere ’ is

used without an ablative by Col. 111 13, in mis·-

conjunction with ‘ subigere.'

⁸ MaecenaS,' to whom the poem is in-
scribed, as the Works and Days to Perses,
the poem of Lucr. to Memmius.

3. ‘Cultus' and ‘curatio’ occur in a
similar connexion, Cic. N. D. 11 63.

‘ Habendo pecori,’ as we should say,
for breeding cattle: nearly equivalent to

4. ‘ Experientia,‘os the
of the bees, whose habits are only described
incidentally. So lv 315, 316 [where see

note, and cp. Stat. Theb. vl 775, ‘ is vigor ‚ ,

ingenie, tanta experientia dextrae est.
H. N ·. ]. ‘ Habetncgies 'dtcl'ien will have to be

cating the bee as 11 is in itsels, not as , ε ·

an object of its keeper's care. 1t has an

appropriateness here, showing that the . ⁰⁹, ⁹

nature of the bees themselves is a art of
the subject of Book ιν. Wagn. an F orb.
refer it to the difficulty os keeping up the
stock of bees. This would agree well
with ‘habend0‚' but the use of ‘ parcus '
would be extremely harsh; it is not sup-
ported by 111 403 (where the epithet is

puted by lgightley.

5. ‘ Hinc inci iam ’ [as opposed to the
EclogueS.—H. .]. Varro R. R. 11 1,
proceeds to his subject with the words
‘incipiam hinc ;' E. VI 41, ‘hinc refert,'
‘ next he sings.’ Voss's interpretation os
‘ hinc ’ as ‘ horum partem,' ‘ ex. his,’ like

and obvious. Pal. originally had ‘ hic.’ ⁹

‘ Incipiam ’ is rather ‘ 1 will undertake ’ τ’
than ‘ 1 will begin ’ (Henry on A. 11 13).
Keightley comp. Lucr. 1 55, ‘ Disserere

5-42. ‘1 invoke sun and moon, the
powers that give corn and wine, the
wood-gods and nymphS, the gods of
