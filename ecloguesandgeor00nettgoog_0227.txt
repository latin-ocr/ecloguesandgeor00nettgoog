venit Apollo :

‘Galle, quid insanis?' inquit; ‘tua cura Lycoris
perque nives alium perque horrida castra secuta est.'
venit et agresti capitis Silvanus honore,

florentis ferulas et grandia lilia quassans,

has yet been given: the usual derivation
of ‘ opilio ’ from ‘ ovis ‘ seems contrary to
the quantitiae os the two first syllables]
‘Opilio’ here is the original reading of
Pal., found also in one or two of Ribbeck’s
cursives, and supported by the grammarian
Caper. The ⁴ opilio ' is mentioned by
Cato R. R. 10 [comp. Varro R.R. lxviii]
among the staff os farm labourerS, one
being required for a property os two
hundred and sorty jugera.
‘Subulci' all the MSS. ;
which Heyne retained, was due to the
earlier modern crities (ParrhasiuS, Ursinus,
ErythraeuS, StephanuS, Cerda: seeTaub-
mann). The reasons alleged for the change
were, (i) the parallel passage in Theocr. 1
80, where swineherds are not named, (ii)
the absence of swineherds elsewhere in
the EclogueS, only cowherds, shepherds,
and gontherds, coming within the dignity
of pastoral poetry, (iii) the probability
that Menalcas from his occu ation is
himself intended for a swineh , (iv) the
allusion in two passages of Apuleius(Flor.
1 3, Apol. p. 407) to Virg.’s ‘opiliones’
and ‘busequae,' (v) a quotation in Terent.
Maur. v. 1191, where however ‘subulci’
has recent? been restored on MSS. au-
thority, an (vi) the epithet ‘ tardi‚' which
is sup to point to the motion os cows,
and consequently os cowherds. In reply
it is sufficient to say that swine are else-
where referred to by Virg. (G. 1 400, 11
72, 520) as belonging to rustic life, while
there is distinct propriety in mentioning
them here, as they were plentisul in Ar·
cadia: that the passages in Apul. do not
{fflerlsslssnl'evissffi ’ἰῗιῖἓὲάιὶζῑξζῑῃωιῗὲἓ
‘ o iliones et busequae ς ’ that ‘ bubulci,']
in eed, would not necessarily be synony-
mous with ‘busequae,' the former word
generally meaning a ploughman, not a
erdman; and, lastly, that ‘tardi ’ im lies
no more than weariness with their ay's
labour‚ which might easil be conceived
of a swineherd‚ even i we had not

‘ bubulci,’

Eumaeus’ complaint os the hardship of
the lise, od. xlv 415 fon.

2ο. Menalcas is probably a husband·
man who has been gathering and steeping
acorns, which were the sood not only of
swine, but, in the winter, of cattle also.
Wagn. refers to Cato R. R. 54, ‘Ubi
sementim patraveris, glandem parari
legique oportet et in aquam conid. Inde
semodios singulis bubus in dies dari
oportet.’ Tlus explains both ‘ hiberna '
and ‘uvidus' For the time of year see
Introd.—Rom. has‘ umidus‚’as in G. 1 418.

21. Theocr- 1 81 foll. ‘A llo' ap-
pears as god of both poet and epherd.

22. ‘Tua cura‚' 1 57. ‘She for whom
you care so cares nought sor you.'

23. SeeIntrod. [Serv. identifies‘alium'
with Antony. In 43 B.C., aster Mutina,
Antony was in S.E. Gaul, and some of
his cavalry chased Dec. Brutus past the
sources of the Rhine. Mr. Nettleship
thought that this might be referred to
here, but it is not probable. It is quite
ffifflffnffirnsss{l'egffssffffffi‘iffi‘fm

24. ‘Silvanus,' G. 1 20, 11 494, A. vm
600. Wund. seems right in replacing the
comma, omitted by Heyne, aster ‘honore,’
so as to make v. 25 epex etical of ‘ venit
agresti honore! With t e construction
he comp. Juv. xl 106, ‘clipeo venientis
et hasta.’

‘ Honore,’ beauty, G. 11 404 note.

25. From Lucr. tv 587, ‘Pan Pinea
semiferi capitis velamina quassans,’ a pas-

e which Virg. has more than once had
ἕστε him: see 11 24, vl 27.

‘ Quassans ’ expresses the size and length
of the fennel and lilies. The use of fennel
flowers sor garlands is vouched for by
Pliny ΧΧῙ 55 (Voss).

26. Virg. emphasizes his having been
allowed to look on Pan, as he was a for-
midable personage (T heocr. 1 16 solt),
and the sudden sight of him produced
madness, hence called ‘ panic ' (Eur. Rhes-
36, etc.). See on Vt 13, 24.
