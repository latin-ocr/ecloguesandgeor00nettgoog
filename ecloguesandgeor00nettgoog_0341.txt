84. Fee, cited by Keightley, says there
are five kinds os arborescent lotus, while
the aquatic lotus contains three varieties,
and the terrestrial and herbaceous (111
394) contains two. ‘ The lotus-tree grows
on the north coast of Africa; it is described
by Theophrastus and Polybius„ and is a
tree of moderate altitude, bearing small
fruits, which are sweet, resembling the
date in flavour.' Keightley.

85. ‘Unam in faciem: comp. A. x
637, ‘Tum dea nube cava tenuem sine
viribus umbram In faciem Aeneae (visu
mirabile monstrum) Dardaniis ornat telis.’

In both passages ‘ in faciem ' is adverbial. ‘

86. Cato v1 mentions eight kinds of
olives, Col. v 8 ten, Macrob. Sat. 111 20
(ιι 16) sixteen.

‘ Orchades ' and ⁶ radii ’ appear to be so
named from their shape. The ‘ orchades ’
(more usually ‘ orchites’) are oblong, the
‘ radii' are long like a weaver’s shuttle.
⁴ Pausia ' requires to be gathered before it
is ripe; hence ‘ amara baca.’ Pliny (xv
13) says that‘the ‘ pausia ’ is athered first,
then the ‘ orchis,’ then t e ‘ radius ; ’
Columella says that the oil os the ‘ pausia ’
ἰέ excellent while itis green, but is spoiled

y887g. ‘ Pomaque et Alcinoi silva'e ε’ “ que’
is disjunctive, as 111 121, ‘ Et patriam
Epirum referat fortisque Mycenas. ‘ Nor
are apples, etc„ of one sort any more than
olives. The orchards of Alcinous (comp.
Od. vu -112 foll.) are the same as the
⁸ poma,' the apple forests of Alcinous
(unless we suppose them to convey a still
more general esignation: apples, and all
Alcinous’ orchard trees).

‘ SurculuS,’ cutting: a poetic variety,
intended to signify not that the pear must
be planted by cuttingS, but that 1t may be.
The meaning of course is that the cuttings
differ as belonging to different trees,

88. ‘ Crustumiis? from Crustumerium
or Crustumium, at the confluence of the

Alia and Tiber. Serv. says they were
partly red. ‘ Syriis ε’ Serv. and Pliny say
they were black. Pliny (xv 53) says that
the Crustumine were the best. The
‘ Syria,’ according to Col. v 10, were also
called ‘ Tarentina. ’ Syrian pears are men-
tioned by Juv. xl 73, and Martial v
lxxviii 13.

‘ Volemis:' the ‘volema’ are named,
without description, by Cat0, and men·
tioned by Pliny merely as spoken of by
Virg. Serv. derives them from ‘vola,’
‘ hand—fillers,' but mentions another ety-
mlplogy from a Gaulish word meaning

89. Here and in vv· 267, 278, 300,
‘ arbos' might mean either the vine or the
tree which supported it, the ‘silvestria
virgulta ’ os v. 2, but the latter is the more
probable. Pliny (xlv 9) and Ulpian (Dig.
353³?ss Th‘ssugffhssehffffi {iimiu‘ffss
distinctly excludes it; Cato lxxxu) con·
trasts ‘arbores ’ and ‘vite5,'and the writers
on agriculture generally, speaking of vine·
yards, use ‘ arbores’ of the trees which
supported the vines. ‘ Arbor ' means the

the vine. · Altogether, there'is no pas·

easy to resist the argument in favour
of the technical sense in a .technical
treatise.

90. Hor. od. 1 xvii 21, ‘ Hic innocentis
pocula Lesbii Duces) ‘ Palmoe ' is the
bearing wood of the vine. Col. v 6.

91· ‘Thasiae vites :’ Athenaeus (1 51)
collects testimonies to the excellence of
the Thasian, Lesbian, and Psithian wines
among others. Pliny also speaks os an
Egyptian wine called Thasian (xlv 74,
