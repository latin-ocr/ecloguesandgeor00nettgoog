THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lxxxix

(ί) In A. x 245 it seems that Longus read spectabis for spectabit,
saying that the word venerit should be supplied after crastina lux.
Macrobius 111 vi 6 has a note of Longus on A. 111 84, which is also given,
without any acknowledgment of its source, in the Cassel additions
to Servius on the passage.

10. URBANUS.

I am not convinced by Ribbeck's argument (Prol. p. 167) from the
mention of Urbanus in Servius’ note on A. v 517, that this commentator
was prior in time to Velius Longus. LonguS, we have seen, made some
remarks in answer to a criticism of Cornutus on Virgil's alleged mistake
in making Aeneas devote to death a pigeon, the bird of Venus: and
it seems that Urbanus had a note to the same purpose. But it would be
rash, surely, to infer from this that Longus was indebted to Urbanus.

On two grounds I am disposed to think that too early a date has been
assigned to Urbanus First, there is not, so far as I am aware, any
mention of him in the Verona scholia. It may be answered that
the Verona scholia as we have them are merely a fragment, and that we
cannot therefore be justified in arguing from their silence. True: yet
even in their fragmentary condition they preserve quotations from a
great number os commentatorS, Asper, CornutuS, Haterianus, LonguS‚
NisuS, ProbuS, Terentius ScauruS, Sulpicius Apollinaris 3 and it would be
strange, had the compiler of these scholia known of a commentary
by Urbanus, that no mention of it should have survived even in a
fragment of his work.

Secondly, the absurdity of the notes attributed to Urbanus seems to
me to stamp them as belonging to a later age than that os TraJan or the
AntonineS. To take a single instance: in A. ιν 469, ‘Eumenidum veluti
demens videt agmina Pentheus? Urbanus seems to have taken‘ agmina'
as meaning the coils of the F uries serpentS. It is easy to imagine how
Probus would have dealt with such a remark. or again with that on
A. ιν 624, ‘nullus amor popuIiS, nec foedera sunt0,' where Urbanus
observed that Virgil had used a legal word, sunto, ‘ propter odia
hereditaria.'

11. CAESELLIUS VINDEX, TERENTIUS SCAURUS,
SULPICIUS APOLLINARIS.

Caesellius Vindex, the compiler osa lexicographical work m fifty books
entitled Lectiones antiquae, arranged in alphabetical order, is quoted
by Gelliu8‚ 11 xvi 5, as giving a sensible explanation of postuma proles m
the sixth Aeneid. He took postumus to mean not‘ post patris mortem
natus? but‘ postremo loco natus? an interpretation for which he was
taken to task by Sulpicius Apollinaris It is easy to conjecture, though
there is no positive proof of the fact, that the work of Caesellius Vindex
may have been used to a far greater extent than now appears by N oniuS,
