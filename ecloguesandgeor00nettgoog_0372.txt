ipsa acie nondum falcis temptanda, sed uncis

P. VERGILI MARONIS

carpendae manibus frondes interque legendae:
inde ubi iam validis amplexae stirpibus ulmos
exierint, tunc stringe comaS‚ tunc bracchia tonde;
ante reformidant serrum3 tum denique dura

exerce imperia, et ramos compesce fluentes

370

Texendae saepes etiam et pecus omne tenendum,
praecipue dum frons tenera imprudensque laborum ;
cui super indignas hiemes solemque potentem

sky, like ‘pura terra' a cleared soil,
⁴ purus locus’ ground not built on. Virg.
has already stated it to be an object that
the branches should expatiate, v. 287, ‘in
vacuum poterunt se extendere rami.'
Comp. ‘ ae'ra per vacuum‚’ 111 109 note.

‘Immissus, launched sreely into the
air. The word is evidently taken from
‘immissis habenis’ in Lucr„ which is
itself represented by ⁶ laxis) according to
Virg.’s habit of hinting at one mode of
expression while actually using another.
[Compare Varro 1 xxxi 3 ‘ vitis immittitur
ad uvas pariendas3’ Cic- Sen. 53 ‘sar-
mentorum inmissio! Reid explains in
all passages of letting loose the reins;
Keil says ‘inmitti dicuntur quae non
deciduntur sed ut crescant relinquuntur.’]

365. ⁸ 1psa‚’sc. ‘vitiS‚' as distinguished
from the leaves· For the ellipse, comp.
⁴ quaeque‚' v. 270.

‘ Acie : ' Med., Rom., Verona fragm.
corn, t;ud.; Pal. and Med. corr. have
‘ acies.' The origin of the variant, which
is older than Serv„ is obvious· ‘Temp-
tanda’ may perhaps imply a dangerous
experiment.

366. ‘ Interlegendae,' picked out.

367. Med. late corr. and some other
MSS. (none of Ribbeck’s) have ‘ viribus'
for ‘ stirpibus.’

368. ‘ Exierint‚'shot up. Comp. v. 81,
‘ Exiit ad caelum.’ Med. and Rom. have
‘tunc' twice in this verse, and Rom.
⁴ tunc ’ in the next t see v. 317 above.

369. ‘ Tum denique‘ herc = ‘ tum de·
mum : ’ ‘ denique ' answering to ‘ ante ’
here as to ‘ antea ’ in Cic. ad. Fam. lx 14,
‘Tantum accessit ad eum amorem, ut
mihi nunc denique amare videar, antea
dilexisse.'

370. ‘ Then is the time to set up a strong
government, and keep down the luxu·
riance of the boughs.' With the metaphor
in ‘ imperia,’ comp. 1 99. There is much

the same feeling in Shakspere, Richard
ΙΙ, Act ιιι Sc. 4,

‘ Go thou, and like an executioner,

Cut off the heads of too fast growing
That 1ngssss loftyjn our commonwealth:
All must be equal tn our government)

For ‘fluentes’ Rom. has ‘valentis.'

371·397. ‘ Cattle should be kept from
the vines when young. Buffaloes and roes
are worse enemies than scorching heat or
killing cold. Hence the goat has been from
time immemorial sacrificed to Bacchus,
both in Attica, at the Dionysia, and in
our Italian vintage rejoicings.’

371. Serv. mentions that some put a
comma before ‘etiam,' some aster it.
Med. a m. pr. omitted ‘ et.’

‘'l'enendum.' here not ‘shut in‚' but
‘ shut out.' Comp. the double meanin of
εἶργειν and ‘arcere.’ Rom. and anot er
MS. have ‘ tuendum‚' which has a differ-
ent sense: see οη v. 195. Some MSS.
(none of Ribbeck’s) add ⁶ est,' which was
the reading before Heins.

372. [⁸Praeterea' Nonius p. 486, for
‘ praecipue.' ‘ Frons: ⁹ Serv. quotes a
‘ vera et antiqua lecti0, fronds ; ’ cp. No-
nius p. 114, 486.-H. N.]

‘ Laborum,’ trials. Comp. v. 343 above.

373. ⁴ Super,' besides, not more than.
The comparison comes in v. 376.

‘ Indignas: ’ Serv„ E. x 10, quotes ‘ in-
dignas turris ' from Ennius in the sense of
‘ magnas.’ If this is true, which without
the context it may be unsafe to assume on
the authority os Serv„ the idea must be
that of immoderateness, already ‘noticed
in the case of ‘improbus.' It may here
however be very well explained with re·
ference to the tenderness of the young
vine, and rendered ⁶ cruel.’

‘ Hiemes' (plural) may mean either
winters or winter weather, just as ⁸ soles ¹
