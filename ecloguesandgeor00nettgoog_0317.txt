and thus proved not to be accidental, and
not observation of the same thing on dif-
ferent occasiom, which seems to be its
force in v. 451. Natural observation is
grounded by Virg. on divine warning.

The important words are ‘ventis sur-

turn are reproduced by Lucan v 5 51-567.

357. Connect ‘agitata tumescere.'

[‘ Altis montibus‚’ probably abl. of
place where (v. 6 note), but possibly of
place whence. There is the same uncer-
tainty in v. 374: see Roby 1173.]

358. ‘Aridus' [os a harsh sound of
breaking and tearing, Lucr. vl 1193

Maurus 332 K of the letter R.—H. N.]
So Kingsley talks of ‘ thunder harsh and
dry.’ In Greek καρφαλέον, αὖον, ξηρόν
are used of sounds (Hom. 11. xul 409,
444, etc. ). Rom. has ⁸ arduus.’

‘ Resonantia longe :' μακρὸν ἐπ’ αἰγιαλοὶ

nantia,' which acts instead of an abl. like
‘murmure’ A. 1 124, ‘tumultu‘ A. 11

sign of wind, com . A. x 97 foll.

favours the omission of ‘ a,’ which is likely
to have been added by a transcribet as
givi the commonet construction.

[⁸ urvis carinis ε ’ ‘ carina ' is the lower
art of the ship’s hull, not merely the
eel but the ‘ shell ' of which the curving

planks form the hull. Hence the e ithets
‘curvae’ here, ‘panda’ 11 445 = the
open hull) ; Nettleshi , Contr. to Latin

conclusive instance of ‘ temperare' fol-
lowed by the abl. without a preposition.

361. There is some difficulty in identi-
fying ‘ mergi ' and ⁸ fulicae) ‘ Mergi ’ are

storm leads Keightley to identify them
with sea-gu115‚ though he admits that this
does not suit Ovid s description (M. xl
794) of the ‘ mergus’ as long-necked.
‘ F ulicae‚’ Keightley thinks, are cormor-
antS, not coots‚ as Pliny xl 122 speaks
os them as crested. On the other hand
Cic. de Div. 1 8, translating Aratu5‚ gives
⁸ fulix ' for ὲρωδιός, the heron. The con-
fusion is further increased by the want of

by Aratus of the heron z what Virg. says
of the ‘fulicae' is said by Aratus os the
αἴθυιαι, which appear from Pliny x 91 to
have been the Greek equivalent ‚to
‘mergi' [Pliny xv111 362 speaks ·of
‘mergi, gaviae, maria aut st a fugi-
{ine} as one of the signs o wind.—

362.] ‘Marinae’ is opp. to ‘in sicc0.'
Lucan (v 553) agrees with AratuS, ‘Aut
siccum quod mergus amat.'
