ness. Owing to the nature of the subject, the passages in which ³

Virgil has directly copied Hesiod are almost entirely confined to

the first two-thirds of the First Book of the GeorgicS. We may ·

conjecture that he may have been indebted in later parts of the
poem to lost Hesiodic writingS, but we shall be conjecturing
with few or no data. Enough however has been said to show
that if the rural poetry of Virgil bears the impress of a genius
unlike that which produced the rural poetry of Hesiod, it is not
because the Roman poet made no attempt to model his work on

the Ίῗῗζειιιιε good fortune which has preserved to us the most

important of Hesiod’s agricultural poems enables us to judge
also of Virgil’s obligations to another writer, whom he has
nowhere named or acknowledged. In the Phaenomena and
Diosemeia, or Prognostics, of Aratus, we have a specimen of
the didactic poetry of the earlier Alexandrian school. Cicer0,
who translated both works, speaks of him in a well-known
passage ¹ as a writer wh0, though ignorant of astronomy, made
an excellent poem about the heavenly bodies ; and one of the
early notices of his life helps us to explain the apparent anomaly
by telling us that his Phaenomena is a metrical paraphrase of a
treatise by Eudoxus, made at the request of his royal patron,
Antigonus GonnataS. He was in fact a metaphrastes, one of a
class of writers not uncommon in the later times of Greek litera-
ture, who paraphrased the works of other authors, sometimes
versifying a prose writer, at others transposing a poet, some·
times turning a hexameter poem into iambicS, at others pre·
serving the metre while they altered the words Sometimes a
successful metaphrase became in its turn the subject of meta·
phrastic ingenuity. Aratus himself was rewritten in iambics by
one MarianuS, an unwearied writer, who attempted similar repro-
ductions of TheocrituS, the Argonautics of Apollonius Rhodius,
several poems of CallimachuS, Nicander’s Theriaca, and, as Suidas
