INTRODUCTION.

THE history of Pastoral Poetry shows us how easily' the most
natural species of composition may pass into the most artificial.
Whatever may have been its earliest beginnings—a question ¹
which seems to belong as much to speculation as to historical
inquiry—it appears not to have been recognized or cultivated as
a distinct branch till the Greek mind had passed its great
climacteric, and the centre of intellectual life had been transferred
from Athens to Alexandria. Yet as introduced into the world by
Theocritus if modern ² criticism is right in supposing him to have
been its real originator, it exhibits little os that weakness and
want of vitality which might have been expected to distinguish
the child of old age. It is a vigorous representation of shepherd
life, with its simple habits, its coarse humour, its passionate
susceptibility, and its grotesque superstition. But it was not
long to retain this genuine character os healthy, dramatic energy.
Already in the next age at Syracuse it began to show signs

¹ The theories of its origin resolve themselves into speculations like those of
Lucretius (v 1382 foll.)‚ as Heyne remarks in his treatise De Carmine Bucolico,
prefixed to his edition. It is easy to see that music is a natural solace sor a shepherd,
and that the whisth‘ng of the wind through the reeds would suggest the use os the
reed as a i e.

² Thelhgmoe os the supposed pastoral poets who preceded Theocritus may be found
in Heyne's treatise, or in the Dictionary of Biography, art. Theocritus. For a de-
structive criticism on their existence or claims to the title, see Nake's Opuscula‚ vol. i
