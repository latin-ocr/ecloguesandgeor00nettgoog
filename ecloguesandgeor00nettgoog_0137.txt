41. Virg. seems to be trying to blend
the two ideas ot' the slave's master and
Octavian with ‘each other. ‘ Praesens’
applied to a god means not so much pro-
pitious as powerful to aid ; the power of a
heathen god being connected with his
presence. ,Hence the word is applied to
a powersul remedy, G. 11 127.

[Cognoscere‚’ find.—-H. N.]

42. There is no getting over the con·
fusion between th'e slave going to buy his
sreedom os his master and the ejected
frecholder going to beg restitution of
V. 45 is quite inapplicable

called ‘ iuvenis’ again G. 1 500 (note) and
by Hor. Od. 1 ii 41. Juv. v 45 gives
the same appellation to Aeneas (comp.
A. lx 88). [‘Quodannis' Pal. and ori-
ginally Rom—H. N. So Ribbeck]

43. ⁴ Bis senos dies,' i.e. twelve days
in the year [perhaps once in a mouth.—
H. N. Mr. Martndin refers to Tibull.
ι iii 34, ‘reddere antiquo menstrua tura
lari.’] The critics say that Octavian
was to be worshipped among the Lares
(Hor. Od. lv v 34, ‘et Laribus tuurn
Miscet numen '); but Cato R. R. 148
says that the ‘Lar familiaris’ is to be
worshi ped on all the Kalends, Nones,

' and 1 es, which would make thirty-six

days in all. The present ‘fumant’ is
used because the sactificeS, which Tityrus
intends to be annual, have already begun.

44. For ‘responsum ’ as an answer to
a petitioner, comp. Hor. Carm. Saec. 55,
⁶ Iam Scythae responsa petunt superbi
Nuper et Indi.’

‘ Primus' denotes the anxiety with
which the response was sought3 it does
not imply that any one else could have

was here that he gave me my first
assurance.'

45. ‘ Pueri ' is the common phrase sor
slaves, like παῖς in Greek, and ‘ child ’ in
old English. But observe how the alle·

emancipate him : his master answers,
‘ Yon shall not be turned out of your land
by my veterans.’

⁴ Summittere,’ to raise for breeding or
propagation, both. os animals and plants.
Comp. G. 111 73, 159, and instances
from the Scriptores Rei Rusticae in
Forcell. It should perhaps be strictly

tite ⁵ as ‘ summittite iug0,' i.e. ‘ domate,’
and the line as an exhaustive description
os sarming. [Non. p. 389 M. takes
‘ summitto ⁹ here and in Georg. 111 73 as
= ‘admitt0,’ and so Serv. on Georg. 111

your land may be, you can enjoy it undis·
turbed and be content. Your flocks will
be healthy‚ and you will live in the shade
by the water, lulled by the hum of the
bee, the song os the vine-dresser, and the
cooing os the dove.'

46. ⁸ Tua' is a predicate, like ‘magnast
Wagn. refers to the phrase ‘ meum est‚’
as in lx 4. ‘ Manebunt' is also predi-

* cate, ‘ It is yours and yours for ever.’

47. Yon (Tityrus or Virgil) are content
with your sarm, though it is all covered
with stoneS‚ and full of pools and rushes
(so that no soldier need envy you its '
possession). ⁶ Palus ' is probably the
overflowing os the Mincio; vu ι 3. ·
