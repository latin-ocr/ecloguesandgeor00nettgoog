LIB. 11. 249

frugibus infelix ea, nec mansuescit arand0,

nec Baccho genuS, aut pomis sua nomina servat— 240
tale dabit specimen: tu spisso vimine quaIOS,
colaque prelorum fumosis deripe tectis;

huc ager ille malus dulcesque a fontibus undae

ad plenum calcentur ; aqua eluctabitur omnis

scilicet, et grandes ibunt per vimina guttae 3

at sapor indicium faciet manifestuS, et ora
tristia temptantum sensu torquebit amaror.

239. 1 have preferred (with Jahn and
Keightley) Wakefi's punctuation: that
commonly adopted [e.g. by Ribbeck and
Thilo] makes the parenthesis begin after
‘infelix.’ The metrical harshness intro·
duced by Wakef.’s punctuation is not
fflzfssffssmzssossexffi 3¹1¹? gnggnrgg‘:
thus becomes subject of a bona fide paren·
thesis, giving the reason why a salt soil
is to be avoided, not of a parenthesis
which is a mere expansion of what has
been said before. In any case ‘ frugibus '
seems used generally of the fruits of the
earth, as v. 173, not specially of corn.

‘ Infelix ’ = ‘ infecunda.’ ‘ Frugibus ’ is ·

bonus pecori, arbori infecundus.' Had it
been ‘ felix ' instead of ‘ infelix‚' we might

Lucr. v 1368, ‘ fructusque feros mansue-
scere terram Cernebant indulgendo blan-
deque colend0.'

240. ‘ Genus ’ is best illustrated by the
adj. ‘ generosus.’ In such a soil the vine
degenerantes„ So we apply the words
⁶ race,’ ‘ racy,’ to wine.

⁶ Nomina‚’ name, for character. This
and ‘ genus ' are metaphors from nobility.
Cato XXV, ‘ Sicque facito studeat bene per·
coctum siccumque legere, ne vinum nomen
perdat.' ‘The grape is not kept true to
its race, nor the apple to its name.’

241. ⁸ Specinwn, prees, in which sense
it occurs Lucr. lv 209, ‘Hoc etiam in
primis specimen verum esse videtur, Quam
celeri motu rerum simulacra ferantur.'

‘ Qualos ' appear to be the same as
⁴ cola.' They were made ‘ spisso vimine ’
that they might strain the wine from the
grapeS. [‘Quallos ' Pal. and Rom, and
so Ribbeck ς “ qualos ' Med.—H. N.]

242. Comp. 1 175 note.

243. ‘ Ager ι ’ the whole ‘ ager ' is virtu·
ally the subject of the experiment-

‘ Malus: ’ he assumes the bitterness,
which he calls malignit (comp. ‘ scele-
ratum f ” s,' v, 256), o the scil, both in
making t e experiment and in its result;
a prose writer would have expressed him·
self hypothetically.

‘ Dulces ’ is emphatic.

244. ⁴ Huc ad plenum calcentur ' ε
‘ huc ad plenum ingerantur et calcentur.'

‘ Calcare ' seems to be used technically
of other kinds of pressure than treading.
Cato (cxvll) says of olives ‘in orculam
calcat0.’

⁸ Ad plenum ' is undoubtedly a phrase
(Hor. Od. 1 xvii 15, etc.), but that is no
reason for giving it, as Forb. suggests,
the vague sense ‘ copiously‚' instead of
taking it ‘ to the full [of the strainer].’ till
the strainer is full. ‘ Eluctabitur,’ ooze out.

245. ⁸ Scilicet ’ denotes the consequence
of the proces& ‘ Yon will see.’

246. Virg. is expressing himself poeti·
cally, not with logical precision. He
marks the progress of the narrative by
‘at,’ distinguishing the water from the
taste of the water, and, as it were, follow-
ing the fortunes of both, though the
meaning is only ‘as the water oozes out,
the taste will show you.’ Comp. vv. 211,
212.

⁸ Manifestus ’ seems plainly to go with
‘faciet,’ not with the following clause,
whichever reading be adopted in 247.
‘ The taste will clearly betray the truth.‘
‘ Indicium facere,' play the tell-tale. ‘ Id
anus mihi indicium fecit‚' Ter. Adelph. w
iv .

‘amaro' Med„ Pal„ Rom„ mentioned
by Serv. Hyginus (in Gell. 1 21)says that
he found in a text which ‘ ex domo fuisset
