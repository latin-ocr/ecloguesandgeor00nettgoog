412 ΟΝ THE LATER

Two fragments os a poem on F owling (Ixeutica or De Aucupio) were
printed in a Dialogue on Birds (Cologne‚ 1544) by Gibertus Longolius¹
who asserted that they had been transcribe-d for him from a copy of a work
by Nemesianus existing in a library at Bologna. Wernsdorf, in opposition
to Ulitius‚ thinks them not unworthy of their reputed author: but in any
case they need not detain us further. [They are probably modern work.]

The elder Pliny, in two passages of his Natural History‚¹ speaks of a
poem by ovid, entitled Halieutica. A fragment on that subject with
Ovid’s name attached to it is found in a MS. containing part of Grattius'
Cynegetica‚ and has been frequently printed in editions of Grattius and
N ernesianu8‚ or as part of Ovid’s works. It would perhaps be too much
to assign it to such illustrious parentage, though Haupt thinks other-
wise : ² but it would not disgraee either of the two poets whom we have
just been considering. Take a specimen.

‘ At contra scopulis crinali corpore segnis

polypus haeret, et hae eludit retia fraude, ·

et sub lege loci sumit mutatque colorem,

semper ei similis quem contigit: atque ubi praedam
pendentem saetis avidus rapit, hic quoque fallit
elato oelamO, cum demum emersus in auras
bracchia dissolvit, populatumque exspuit hamum.
at mugil eauda pendentem everberat escam
exeussamque legit. lupus acri concitus ira
discursu fertur vario, fluctusque ferentis
prosequitur, quassatque caput, dum volnere saevus
laxato eadat hamus, et ora patentia linquat.’

Another fragment with the same argument was published by Hiero·
nymus Columna in his Commentary on the Fragments of Ennius, having
been transcribed from an old MS. by Sertorius QuadrimanuS. More
ambitious than the former, to which however it is indebted sor several
linea it professes in its exordium to be the work of Ovid, who speaks
of himself as led to his subject by the scenes of his exile: but though
the lines in which the profession is made are not without ability, those
who should credit it would be compelled to suppose that Ovid’s re-
moval from Rome had made him forget the quantity of the first syllable
of ⁸ dirig0‚’ as he ventures to address Glaucus—

‘ Quare si veteris durant vestigia moriS‚
si precibus hominum flectuntur numina ponti,
huc adsiS‚ dirigasque palea, umerosque natantis.'

The date of Q. Serenus Sammonicus is at any rate earlier than that

¹ Book xxxxi, chaps. ii and xi.
² [Most modern scholars agree with Haupt ε see Teuffel, 2504]
