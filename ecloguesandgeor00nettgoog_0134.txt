21. ‘Depellere,' or, in the tull expres-
sion, ‘depellere a lacte‚’ is to wean, 111
82, vu 15, G. 111 187, etc.: and some
take it so here, reading ‘ quoi' sor ‘quo,²
or even rendering ‘ qu0,’ ‘for' instead of
‘ to which.’ But the sense requires some·
thing equivalent to gm'ng to the city.
‘ Pellere,' for driving a flock, is found in
‘ compellere: 11 30, etc. The ‘ de ' need
not be explained by supposing that Andes

was on a hill: it denotes the destination‚ ⁹

as in ‘ deducere‚' ‘ demittere navis (in
portum),’ etc. It may have been the
custom in Columella’s time to sell lambs

23. It may be questioned whether
‘ parvis componere magna ' means to com·
pare cities with dogs and goats‚ i.e. to
argue from the latter to the former, or to
compare the larger member of a class
with the smaller: but the latter is more
natural, and recommended by ‘ solebam.²
