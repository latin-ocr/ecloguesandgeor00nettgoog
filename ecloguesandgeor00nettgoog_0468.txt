the only ceses made out as probable are
such as 11 171 soll.. 111 32, where the in-
sertion, is it be an insertion, is not an ex·
crescence on the poem. but carefully ren·
dered homogeneous with it : while it may
be doubted whether there is any other in-
stance in Vi . (the general integrity of
whose text isrgbeyond suspicion), where it
can be shown to be really likely that
lines have been transposed.

Perhaps we are wrong in seeking for
close connexion in a context like this,
where, as has been remarked on v. 191,
the various notices of the habits of bees
seem to be rather isolated from each other.
However‚ it may be suggested that the
mention of the constant succession re·

minded virg. of the accidents which carry

proof of the energy of the race; thence he
was led to observe that, in spite of the
