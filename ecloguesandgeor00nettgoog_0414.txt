Ρ. VERGILI MARONIS

ingentis tollent animOS, prensique negabunt
verbera lenta pati et duris parere lupatis,

Sed non ulla magis vires industria firmat,
quarn Venerem et caeci stimulos avertere amoris 210
sive boum sive est cui gratior usus equorum.
atque ideo tauros procul atque in sola >relegant
pascua, post montem oppositum, et trans flumina lata;
aut intus clausos satura ad praesepia servant.

carpit enim vires paulatim uritque videndo

semina, nec nemorum patitur meminisse nec herbae
dulcibus illa quidem inlecebriS‚ et saepe superbos
cornibus inter se subigit decernere amantis.

207. ‘ Prensi z '
boves,’ 1 285 note.

208. ‘ Lenta‚’ a perpetual epithet.
‘ Lupatis :' ‘ dicta lupata a lupinis denti-
buS, qui inaequales sunt‚' Serv. So λύκος
is used in Greek, and ‘lupus' by Ovid
and Statius· Both ‘lupatum ’ and ‘ lupa-
tus’ are found as substantives, and Hor.
od. 1 viii 6 uses ‘ lupatis ’ as an epithet of
‘frenis-² [Comp. also Ovid Tr. lv vi 3.]

209-241. ‘ The chief danger to the
strength both of bulls and horses is from
excess os the passion os love. Thus bulls
have to be kept at a distance from the
cows, Rivalries osten arise among
them ; they sight for the same heifer 3 the
beaten one retires, and after a lo in-
terval. during which he has been co lect-
ing flhist ,strengtln returns and renews the
con ιε .

211. ‘ Whether you prefer rearing bulls
or horses.’ ‘ Cui ' belongs to ‘ si ' in ‘ sive.'
[Fragm. Vat. 0 ‘ inally had ‘ bovom,’ and
so Ribbeck.— . Ν. The form occurs
also in MSS. of Varro: Keil, Comm. on
R. R. p. 172.]

212. The political word ‘ relegant ' suits
the language of the paragraph; the bulls
are spoken of internis appropriate to men,
and so invested with a kind os heroic dig-
nity. There is a special fitness in the
word, as the essence os ‘relegatio' was
confinement to or exclusion from a par·
ticular place.

213. The intervening hill excludes the
view: the breadth of the stream prevents
crossing. ·>

‘ prensos domitare

214. ⁴ Satura,' to keep up their strength
and divert them.

215. ‘Caeco carpitur igni,’ A. ιν 2.
‘Videndoz’see E. vm 71. Here it =
‘ visu,' ‘ by the sight of her.’

217. Ribbeck (after Klotz) seems right
in connecting ⁴ dulcibus—inlecebris ’ with
the receding clause, ‘illa quidem’ having
the orce of ‘quamvi5‚’ as Α. lx 7963 x
385,—‘ she wastes them away, though
with a tendet· passion!

219. ⁴ Sila' (Rom. Med. corr.) is rnen-
tioned by Serv„ tho h with disapproval,
and has been accept by most edd. since
Heyne3 the other MSS. aud Serv. give
‘silvas The specification of a particular
forest is quite in the manner os W irg.‚ and
is in place here, announcing, as if by a
change of tone, that a narrative descrip-
tion follows. For ‘Sila' comp. A. ΧΠ
715 (a fight of bulls) ¹ ingenti Sila, sum-
move Taburno ; ' sor the whole line Hor.
Ep. 1 iii 36, ⁴ pascitur in vestrum reditum
votiva iuvenoest ·

220. The language in A. x11 7²0 foll.
is very similar. The conflict there is not
sor a particular heifer, but sor the sove-
reignty of the herd. The descriptions in
Ov. M. vm 46, Stat. Theb. vt 864
agree in their general detail with the
passage in the Aeneid, but represent the
object of the combat as here. All the

between Heracles and Acheloum, Soph-

Trach. 517, [but the resemblance is really
very slight}
