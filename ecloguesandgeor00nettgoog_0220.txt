P. VERGILI MARONIS

ecce Dionaei processit Caesaris astrum,
astrum, quo segetes gauderent frugibus, et quo
duceret apricis in collibus uva colorem.

insere, Daphni, piros; carpent tua poma nepotes.¹

omnia fert aetaS, animum quoque; saepe ego longos
cantando puerum memini me condere soles:

nunc oblita mihi tot carmina; vox quoque Moerim
iarn fugit ipsa; lupi Moerim videre priores

arrangement is supported by Pal. and
others [as well as by Serv. ], and suits the
context· it is plain that vv. 51 soll.
would not have much meaning except
on the supposition that Moeris had re-

ted part of what Lycidas had asked
’ or, and was lamenting that he could not
recall more.

Daphnis is addressed as the representa·
tive of the shepherds, who watch the stars
sor agricultural purposes rposes.(G 1 204 foll„
257, 258). ‘Antiquos’ is transferred from
‘signorum ’to‘ ortus)

W47.g¹ A comet appeared while Octavian

dictator’ s apo theosisp (Suet. CaeS. 88,
Serv. here simnd A. vm 861, Plin. Ν. Η.
11 93). Comp. Hor. Od. 1 xii 47, ‘micat
inter omnis Iulium sidus)

‘Dionaei' as the descendant of Venus„
who' rs called‘ Dionaea mater,' A. 111 19.
‘Processit,’ os the rising of a star, vl 86.

48. The Julian star is to be the sarmer’ s
star, as Julius' ιιι v 79 is the farmer’ s god,
and Octavian also (G. 1 24 fou. ).

‘’Quo denotas the agency, not, as in
‘quo sidere? G. 11, the time. The rising
of the star m ht natural! be thesign
for harvest an vintage( . 125)
Virg. evidently expresses himself ere as
if the stars not only formed the shep herd' s
calendar, but actually soretold or created
agricultural prosperity. Keightley sug-
gests that the summer of 44, when the
comet appeared, would naturally have
been hot and dry3 and we may be re-
minded of our own belief m the effect of
comets upon the vintage.
‘Segete3‚' of fields, as in G. 1 47.

[‘ Gauderent,' ou ht to be rejoicing.
Comp. A. v1534.— -ffil Ν. Seep.114.]

49. ‘Duceret—colorem? ‘variis solet
uva racemis Ducere urpureum nondum
matura οοίοιειιι,’ον. gl. 111484, ‘Uvaque
conspecta livorem ducit ab uva,’Juv. 1181.

50. ‘ Poma’ are the fruit which are to
grow on the pear-tree.

‘Insere pirOS, ’ 1 74. The meaning is
not merely that the trees shall beat for
more than oue generation, but that the
sarmer’s posterity shall enjoy the property
ofh th eir progenitor. Serv. says ‘Hoc in
gratiam Augusti, per cuius beneficium
securus de suis est. .Ac si diceret,
Nihil est quod possis timere. nam illud
{ffffi‘nffi‘z‘} ἰῗὲἷῖιέἶῗᾶῖᾎῗῗῶώὲἱιῑιὶἔῗέ.
(vlu 3, ιιι 6) says that pears may be
grafted ιιι August, or, if the soil is moist
(which ts the case near Mantua), in July.

down: Callim. Ep. 11 3, ἥλιον ἐν λέσχῃ
κατεδύσαμεν, Lucr. 111 1090, ‘vivendo

53. ‘Oblita,’ assive: a rare use, fol
lowed by Val. . 1 792,11 388 [.3etc

purely literary. ]

54. A man meeting a wolf and not·
catching its eye first was supposed to be
struck dumb. Pliny, vlu 80, speaks of
it as an Italian belief: it is also alluded
to by Plato, Rep. 1, p. 336, where So-
