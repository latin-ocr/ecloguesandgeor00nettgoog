P. VERGILI MARONIS

horridior ruSCO, proiecta vilior alga,
si mihi non haec lux toto iam longior anno est.
ite domum pasti, si quis pudor, ite iuvenci.

C. Muscosi sontes et somno mollior herba, 45
et quae vos rara viridis tegit arbutus umbra,
solstitium pecori defendite; iam venit aestas
torrida, iam lento turgent in palmite gemmae.

T. Hic focus et taedae pingues», hic plurimus ignis
semper, et adsidua postes fuligine nigri; 50

only mean to s ow how much better he

‘ Sardoniis. The technical name for
the plant is ‘ Rapunculus SardouS‚’ βατ-

that its eaves {phfflffiffiffiffl'ty produce
inflammation. ose who ate it had their
faces distorted into the proverbial Sardonic
smne-[as we are told by Solin'iss‘iffid‘servss,

uoting Sallust} Thyrsis contrasts it with
{ibe thyme of Hybla, as producing pro·
verbially bitter honey (⁸ Sardum mel, Hor.
A. Ρ. 375). So ‘horridior rusco ' is con-
trasted with ‘ candidior cycni8,' and ‘ vilior
alga ² with ‘ hedera formonsior alba.’

42· ‘ Rusc0‚’ G. 11 413. ‘ Proiecta’ is
em hatic: which is thr-own on the shore,
an which no one mres to take up.
‘ Vilior alga,’ Hor. S. 11 v 8.

43. Theocr. ΧΠ 2, οἱ δὲ ποθεῦντες ἐν
ἤματι γηράσκουσι, Anth. Pal. ΧΗ 171. .

44. He lays the blame on the cattle,
as if they were delaying his pleasure by
delaying at their food. ‘ Si quis pudor‚'
an appeal at once to their moderatiori in
garing, and to their regard for him. It is
the same notion as ‘improbus anser,’ G.
1 119, where see note.

45-48. ‘ Cor. My flocks shall have water,
and graSS, and shade: summer is at the
full of heat and beauty.’

45. ‘ Muscosi,‘ gushing from the mossy
rock. Catull. vaul 58, Hor. Ep. 1 x 7.

‘ Somno mollior,’ ὕπνω μαλακώτερα,
Theocr. v 51, of a fleece (comp. xv 125).
μαλακός is an epithet of ὕπνος, as old as
Hom. (11. x 2), like ‘ mollis’ of ‘ somnus,’
G. 11 470, etc.‚ and is as likely to have
‚suggested the comparison as any resem-
blance in the things themselves? The

address is imitated from Theocr. vm 33
foll„ 37 foll.

⁴6. ‘ Rara,’ see on v 7.

47. ‘ Defendit aestatem capellis( Hor.
Od. 1 xvii 3. It is difficult to say whether
in this and similar instances the dative is
to be explained as one of personal rela-
tion, ‘ on behalf of,’ or as originally iden-
tical with the ablative.

‘solstitium' G. 1 100.

48. With ‘ aestas torrida ² Gebauer
comp. Theocr. vt 16, lx 12. Corydon
mentioned the summer for its heat, but he
is led to dwell on its beauty‚ a proof of
his superiority to Thyrsis.

49. Thyrsis’ picture, as Keightley re· Ἰ
marks, is like a Dutch pendant to Cory-
don’s Claude Lorraine. Its fault is its
subject: yet it is the one which would
most naturally be expected to follow
