come from Theophr. l. c.‚ who mentions
stones, not the ‘lapis bibulus,' as per·
forming something of the same office as
manure.

the spirits os another.

ἤδη. ‘ idi iam iuvenem, premeret cum
serior aetas, Maerentem stultos praeteriisse
dies,' Tibull. 1 iv 33. ‘Reperti‚’ like
‘quid dicam,’ 1 104, etc.‚ a merely rhe-
toggzil. c‘hgtxtzp'gr ’ goes with ‘ urgerent.’ It
can hardly be meant that the stone or
potsherd is to be laid on the plant, which
would thus be crushed ς we must suppose
that they are intended to overhang it.
Theophr. means them to be put at the
side. Mr. Long sayS‚ ‘ The “ testa '’ will
prevent the earth from being washed away,
a necessary precaution when the vines are
on a slope: and it also prevents the
ground round the roots from being
patched and made hard.' [Mr. Marindin
compares Xen. Oeconom. xlx 14]

‘ Atque ' is disjunctive.

‘ Ingentis ιε’ Med. a. m. pr. and Nonius
p· ἐξ g‘nheocingen-nhoe ’ is a repetition,
not a distinction. ‘Ad,’ πρός, with a

354-361. ‘When the sets are planted,
dig and plough the ground thoroughly,
and make poles and rods to assist the
vines in climbing.'

354. ‘ Seminibus positis ι ’ he seems now
to be speaking exclusively of the vines.

‘ Diducere ξ ’ Rom. ; ‘ deducere ' Med.
‘Diducere,’ to break, seems alone suited
to the sense. ‘ Diducit scopulos et mon·
tem rumpit acet0,’ Juv, x 153. The
question was one of orthography to the
ffffiffffe're,ffisspffissssufflffigfftpfssfffi
that the earth is to be constantly oed up
to the stems, the rains washing it away
and exposing the roots. For the precept,
see Col. 1v 3, 5 2, Arb. 13.

repeatedly in Cato, e. g. c. 33, ‘capita
vitium per sementim ablaqueato ; . . .
circum capita addito stercus3 . . . cir-
cum capita sarrit0.' Comp. Aristot. de
Long. et Brev. Vitae vl 7, τὸ γὰρ ἅνω τοῦ

used κεφαλοβαρῆ of trees with bea roots.
In Col. 111 10, etc„ and Cic. de n. 15
[see Reid’s note], ‘caput ' bears a totally
different sense, the upper branches of the
vine. So the word has opposite senses as
applied to rivers ξ see on 1v 319.

‘ Bidens ' is a two-pronged hoe, with a
head weighing about ten poundS, and
used more like a pickaxe than a hoe,
whence ‘iactare’(Ke1ghtley). The weight
is denoted by ‘valido consueta bidenti
ww... πῆξ]
connexion, the word denotes that the task
is severe and the work done thoroughly,
like the epithets in vv. 237, 264. Col. 111
13 mentions digging and ploughing as
alternativeS, the distance between the
tows being regulated according to the
employment of one ot the other, from
