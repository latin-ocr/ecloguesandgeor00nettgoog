‘transmittere naves flumen,' and the like.
The principle underlying all such sen·
tences is this, that the active verb,
though accidentally thrown itself into a
passive form, still retains its gov

er, and retains theacc. which it woul

m taken had the sentence been cast in
an active form. Just so in English we
ῗέιέἳῖωέ, ssaehffssffz.}3zff‘¹51?ass ἑοῗῖξ
are accusatives after ‘ask' and ‘tell.

‘he asked me a questionss ‘he told me a
story’ being the active forms of the sen·
tence. —H. N. See also 482 below. ]
