INTRODUCTION. 1 39

sake and for the sake of other3‚ and legend, fable, and precept
are employed by turns to bring him to a sense of past misconduct
and present duty. The subject is introduced, as it were, by a
fresh leaf out of the Theogony, in which, however, the mytho-
logical element is subordinated to the moral, a description of
two goddesses of strife‚ whom we may distinguish in modern
language as Discord and Emulation5 the first the source of war
and misery, the second of honourable endeavour. But the moral
is for PerseS, who is warned not to waste time which a busy man
can ill spare on the false strife, forensic wrangling, but to have
the question of his own and his brother’s inheritance settled by
impartial arbiterS, not, as at the last trial of the suit, by judges
whom he' had bribed. For him, too, is told the legend of
Prometheus and Zeus, showing how Pandora first brought evil
among mankind, who had lived till then untroubled by hard
toil and grievous sickneSS, and concluding thence that there is no
way of escape from the eye of Zeus. That tale being over,
Perses is asked if he will hear another, and bidden to lay it up
deep 'in his heart. Then follows the narrative of the five ageS,
in the last of which men are now living, an evil time, when
father shall be at variance with child, guest with host, friend with
friend, and brother with brother3 when justice and conscience
shall not be found in the hands of men, but the base shall
supplant the more noble, speaking crooked words and shall
swear a false oath. One more tale is told, a very brief one,
addressed to kings and judges of the earth. It consists simply
of a reply by a hawk to a nightingale struggling in his talonS,
and appealing for mercy, a reply which amounts to no more
than that she is absolutely at his disposal and had better not
resist3 the intention doubtless being to put the case of oppres-
sion in all its naked repulsiveneSS, that human perverters of
justice may understand and pause in their wrongful course.
Passing from fable to a more direct mode of appeal, he again
exhorts both Perses and the judges. The former is bidden to
‘look on this picture and on this ;’ on the flourishing city os
the just, where there are peace and festal doingS, where the oak
carries acorns at its top and honey at its core, where the children
resemble their parents, and none go on shipboard‚ for earth
