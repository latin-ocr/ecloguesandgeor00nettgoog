blessings, let me hear more of such verses.
I am something of a poet myself, though
the shepherds overrate me.'

30. ‘Sic' in adjurations, x 5. ‘May
your bees (1 55, vn 13) continue to give
good honey.' The use is virtually the
same as that of ‘ sic ' or ⁴ ita ' in protesta-
tionS‚ when it is frequently, though not
alwayS, followed by ⁶ ut.’ ‘Sic has deus
aequoris artis Adiuvet, ut nemo iamdudum
litore in isto . . . Constitit,’ Ov. M. vm

N.] There seems no authority for repre-
senting Corsica (called Cyrnus by the
Greeks; see Dict. Geogr.) as famous for
yews, which is assumed b several os the
commentatos. But the oney of Cor-
sica, though known historically as one of
its articles of produce, was, like that of
Sardinia (vn 41), proverbially bitter (Ov.
Am. 1 xii 20, ‘mel infame ³), and, as ⁸ the
baleful yew ' (G. 11 257) was prejudicial to
bees (G. 1v 47), Virg. seems, as Martyn
observes, to have thought himself at
liberty to connect the two. So Ov.
l. c. affects to suppose that the Corsican
goney must be collected from hemlock·

where it is given to goats‚ as here to cows,
to increase their milk.

32. ‘ Si quid habeS,' 111 52, note. The
remainder of Lycidas’ speech is from
Theocr. vn 37 soll.

⁸ poetam? not ‘ vatem! It can hardly
be doubted that Virg. means to distinguish
between ‘ poeta’ and ‘vates,' Lycidas
asserting himself to be ‘ poeta,’ while he
does not claim the honours of the ‘ vates!
What the precise distinction is, cannot
easily be determined from the usage of
words either in Virg. (who scarcely uses

‘poeta' except in the Eclogues) or in
other writers 3 but we may perhaps inser
from the other sense of ‘vates' that it
would naturally denote a bard in his in·

(quoted by Martyn), shows that it suggested
the notion of eminence. In Theocr. l. c.
the shepherd says that he is the shrill
mouth of the MuseS, and that all call him
the best singer. [‘ Set ’ Pal.-H. N .]

[Varius is the celebrated t of
epic and tragedy: C. Helvius inna‚ a
friend os Catullus, was chiefly known for
his ‘Smyrna,' a learned in the
Alexandrian manner, on which he was

alluded in his ‘nonumque prematur in

36. ‘ Argutos—olores,’ an expression os
the same class as those referred to on vm

not to a contest between geese and swanS,
but to geese spoiling the melody of swans'
songs by their cackling.
