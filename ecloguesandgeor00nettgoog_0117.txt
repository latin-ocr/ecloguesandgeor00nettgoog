exists beyond. They see with the eyes of otherS‚ not with their
own ; but their soul nevertheless receives the vision. Over such
minds the recollection of a word in a book has the same power
which others find in a remembered sight or sound. It recalls not
only its own image, but the images which were seen in company
with it: nay, it may touch yet longer trains of association, and
come back upon the memory with something like the force of
the entire body of impressions originally excited by the work
which happens to contain it. Even those who have held more
direct intercourse with nature are not insensible to the operation
of this secondary chami. Can any one who reads Milton doubt
that the mere sound of the stately names of classic history and
mythology exercised a real influence on the poet's fancy? And
Mr. Tennyson has given us a testimony ¹ to the constraining
magic of Virgil's own language‚ where he speaks os himself as
haunted during his journey from Como not by the thought of
the overflowing lake, but by the‘ ballad— burthen music ’of Lan
Maxume.

It is not, however, the existence of imitation alone, considered
merely as imitation, that makes us speak of the Eclogues as
unreal. Imitation involves the absence of reality‚ just as transla-
tion doeS‚ simply because the thing produced is not original:
but it need not imply its destruction. But with the Eclogues the
case is different. It is not merely that Virgil formed his con-
ception of pastoral poetry from Greek modeIS, but that he sought
to apply it to Roman life. In the vocabulary of poetry, as he
understood it, a shepherd was a Sicilian, or perhaps an Arcadian ;
therefore an Italian shepherd must be spoken of as an Italian
Sicilian, and pastoral Italy as Sicilian Italy. Instances of this
historical and geographical confusion meet us in every page of
the EclogueS. The very fact that the names of the shepherds
are invariably Greek would naturally be sufficient to warn us
what we are to expect. The introduction of men called
Meliboeus and Tityrus talking about Rome leaves us no room
to wonder at any further mixture of incongruities. Yet the
lengths to which this confusion is pushed have been overlooked
by the majority of scholars 3 nor am I aware of any one, with the
