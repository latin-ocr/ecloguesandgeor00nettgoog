P. VERGILI MARONIS

urit enim lini campum segeS, urit avenae,
urunt Lethaeo perfusa papavera somno:
sed tamen alternis facilis labor; arida tantum

ne saturare fimo pingui pudea't sola, neve

effetos cinerem immundum iactare per agros,

sic quoque mutatis requiescunt fetibus arva,

nec nulla interea est inaratae gratia terrae.

saepe etiam sterilis incendere profuit agros

atque levem stipulam crepitantibus urere flammis: 85
sive inde occultas vires et pabula terrae

pinguia concipiunt; sive illis omne per ignem
excoquitur vitium, atque exsudat inutilis umor;

77. The general sense is that the same
crop, invariably repeated, will exhaust the
soil. Flax. oats. and ppies are specified
merely as instanooe o this mle, though of
course they are chosen as ε’ nificant in·
stances. Virg. then adds t at, though
this is the tendency os these erops in
‘themselveffi it need not be apprehended
when they alternate with each other, if
only the soil is renovated after each crop
by lentisul manuring. This is substan·
tial y the interpretation of Wagn., and
seems the onl satisfactory one.

‘ Lini ι ’ ⁸ remellius obesse maxime ait
solo virus ciceris et lini, alterum quia sit
salsae, alterum quia sit fervidae naturae,’
Col. 11 13, who quotes this passage.

78. G. lv 545, ‘ Lethaea papavera‚'
where see note 3 A. v 854.

79. ⁸ Labor’ of the field. ‘Rotation
will lighten the strain.’ ‘Mox et sru-
mentis labor additus,' v. 150. ‘Arida’
and ‘ effetos' are emphatic—aster the
parch' and exhausting effect of each

give it its· fill of rich manure: think os
the exhausted field, and fling about the
grimy ashes broadcast.‘

80. ‘ Pudeat,' because shame restrains
men from excess in any thin . Comp. E.
vn 44 note. ‘ lactare' in t e same way
seems to impl prosuseness.

81. [Rom. has ‘effectos-’—H. N.]

82. ⁴ Sic quogue' is explained by ‘ mu-
tatis fetibus. · est is gained bya change
of crops as well as by leaving the land un-
tilled. Rom. has ‘ requiescent.’

83. ‘Nor is the land meantime, while
enjoying its rest, thankless and un·

fruitful‚ because unploughed.’ '‘ Gratia’
is said of land which repays the labour
bestowed on it, and restores the seed
committed to it with interest. ‘Siccum‚
densum, et macrum [agri genus] . . . ne
tractatum quidem gratiam reseret,’ Col. 11
2, 5 7. 80 Martial uses ‘ingratus ' os a
field that does not bear.

‘ Inaratae terrae,’ genitive after ‘gratia,'
the thanklessness of unploughed land ς the
thanklessness‚ as it were, of that which
has nothing to be thankful sor.

84·93. ‘ Burning stubble is a good
thing, either as invigorating the soil, or
as getting rid os its moisture‚ or as open-
ing its potes, or as acting astringently.'

corn had been carried, and which there-
fore have nothing but the stubble on them.

85. ‘Levem stipulam,’ v. 289. Emm.
comp. Ov. M. 1 492, ‘thue leves sti-
pulae demptis adolentur aristis! The
most common mode of reaping was to
cut the corn in the middle of the straw‚
leaving the rest in the ground; Varro,
R. R. 1 50. The rhythm again is accom-
modated to the sense.

86. Daubeny (pp. 91 soll.) accepts all
Virg.'s reasons but the last, ‘seu durat,'
etc„ remarking that light and sandy soils
are injured by the operation. He adds
that the ancients do not seem to have
reached the modern practice of burning
away the turs, though Virg.'s words
wflould be a good statement os its salutary
e ectS.

88. ‘Vitium’ as the cold in soils 'is
called ‘ sceleratum‚' 11 256.
