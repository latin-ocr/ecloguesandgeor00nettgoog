LIBER PRIMUS.

THE subject of the First Book is the tillage of the ground with a view to crops, chiefly
corn. The mention of the uncertainty of the weather at different seasons leads the
poet (v. 351) to give a list of the signs of storms and os fair weather, abridged from
the Diosemeia of Aratus. From this he passes (v. 461) to the signs of the political
storm which had broken over Rome, shows that external nature had been no laes
eloquent there, and prays that Octavian may be spared to save society.

The events mentioned in the concluding lines have usually been considered to
point to the earlier part of the period (37·29) during which Virgil is supposed to
have composed the GeorgicS, and to the time immediately preceding that period.
Mr. Merivale, on the other hand, believes the passage to have been written early in
32, during the general expectation of war between Octavian and Antony. His
explanation deserves quoting, both for the ingenuity of the conception and for the
rhetorical ability with which it is enforced. ‘ The prevailing sentiment of gloomy
yet vngue forboding found expression in the voice of a youthsul enthusiast. Cherished
by Maecenas», and honoured with the smiles of Octavian himself, Virgil beheld in the
sway of the chief of the Romans the sairest augury of legitimate and peacesul govern-
ment. With strains of thrilling eloquence not less musical than those with which
Lucretius had soared into the airy realms of imagination, he descended to the subject
of the honr, and gave words to the thoughts with which every bosom was heaving.
He invoked the native gods of Italy, with Romulus and Vesta, guardians os Tuscan
Tiber and Roman Palatine, to permit the youthful hero to save a sinking world. He
reminded his countrytnen of the guilt of their fathers’ fathers, which had effaced the
landmarks of right, and filled the world with wars and a thousand forms of crime.
He mourned the decay of husbandry‚ the dishonour of the plough, the doeohtion of
the fields: he sighed over the clank of the armourer's forge, and the training of the
rustic conscript. It was not the border skirrnishes with the Germans or the Parthians
that could excite such a phrenzy of alarm: it was the hate of neighbour against
neighbour, the impending conflict of a world in arms. The foes of Rome were indeed
raging against her, but her deadliest enemy was of her own household. Virgil pointed
to the Rhine and the Euphrate8‚ but his eye was fixed upon the N ile! (Hist. iii 303,
ed. 1.) In a note, after quoting vv. 509·511, he adds: ‘ln the year 37 there was
actual warfare on the Rhine and the Euphrates, but at that time there was apparent
harmony between the triumvirs, and the prospect at least of universal pacification.
On the other hand, in the year 32, there was no apprehension of hostilities on the
eastern or the northern frontier, but there was a general foreboding of civil war.’
[Mr. Nettloehip also referred the passage to the period just before Actium, i.e.
approximately to 32. But the language is too vague to justify a positive conclusion ;
it suggests rather that Virg. had no special circumstances in his mind when he wrote.
See the noteS, esp. on vv. 509, 510.]
