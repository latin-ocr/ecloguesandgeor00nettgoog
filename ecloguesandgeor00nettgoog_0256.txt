he appears to have been honoured after his death by having his
works subjected to the same process which he had tried on those
os others; and he receives from Cicero a similar equivocal com-
plimentffithat he had written admirably on agricultural subjectS‚
without ever having had the slightest connexion with agriculture.
But though the translator of Aratus includes them in the same
eulog-y, they appear to have received very different degrees os
consideration. One of the points on which the latest editor of
Nicander has laboured most is to prove that his author was never
much read. ‘ Nicander parum lectus ’ is a thesis which is dilated
on more than once in his Prolegomena. The poet had his meta-
phrastes; he had his scholiasts; he seems even to have had his
interpolators; but he was but little read, even by those who,
journeying over the same ground, might have been expected to
avail themselves of the notes of a former traveller. DioscorideS,
CelsuS, Scribonius Largus, Galen, Serenus SammonicuS, OribasiuS,
Aetius Amidenus, Paulus Aegineta, Theophanes N onnuS, and
Ioannes Actuarius, are successively passed under review, to show
that they attended to Nicander very slightly or not at all. Nor
can it be said that he is likely to receive from modern readers the
favour which was denied him by those who approached more
nearly to his own time. The interest which attaches to him is
purely historical and philological. He is supposed to have lived
ninety years after Aratus ; and his language shows plain marks
of an increasing corruption in taste. He wrote a work on γλῶσσαι,
and his own poerns contain many words which would fall under
that category; terms borrowed from Homer, and used in ques-
tionable or altogether unauthorized senses ; terms borrowed from
the local usage of the different Greek nations, the Aeolians, the
AetolianS, the Ambracians, the CyprianS, the DorianS, the Pelo·
ponnesianS, and the Rhodians; terms invented by his own in-
genuity, through the process os derivation or composition. The
structure of the two poemS, so far as 1 have examined them,
seems to be not unlike that which is familiar to the readers of
didactic poetry. Each commences with a brief address to the
person to whom the poem is inscribed, and a brief statement of
the subject, in the one case a description of noxious reptileS, and
of the cures sor their bites, in the other an account of edible and
