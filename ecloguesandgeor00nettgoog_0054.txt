1 VIRGIL AND HIS ANCIENT CRITICS.

in any case to suspect that the passages from Latin authors collected
in the sixth book of Macrobius came directly or indirectly from this
work. It is remarkable that in this book there are apologetic remarks
on the propensity of the ancient writers to steal from one another: 1 3,
‘ exprobrantibus tanto viro alieni usurpationem, nec considerantibus
hunc esse fructum legendi, aemulari ea quae in aliis probeS‚' etc. Compare
vl ii 33, ‘ nec Tullio compilandO, dummodo undique ornamenta sibi
conferret, abstinuit': a hostile remark admitted inadvertently, as so
often, by Macrobius into a context where it is out of place. Now these
general remarks about plagiarism would have been better in place at the
head of the passages from Homer collected in the fifth book: and Ι
am tempted therefore to suppose that they were suggested by observa-
tions on this question which Macrobius found in the works from which
he got the instances quoted in Book vr. This work may or may not
have been the furta of Perellius Faustus. But it seems in any case to
have been a work which Servius did not much use, for (except in the
case of Ennius) he quotes from Latin authors mainly for the purpose of
grammatical, or historical, or philosophical illustration.

The passages of neutral tone, in which Virgil's obligations to Homer
are simply pointed out, it is natural to assign to the ὁμοιότητες of
Octavius Avitus; whether this is also the case with the passages in
which Virgil is said to have drawn upon recondite Greek sources is, I
should think, doubtful, nor arn I at present able to offer any hypothesis
on this point. «

Tuming to the passages where Virgil is defended against hostile
criticism, it is natural to suppose that when his alleged plagiarisms from
Homer, or alleged mistakes or want of management in his narrative are
in question, the ultimate source os the notes both in Servius and
Macrobius is the work of Asconius Contra obtrectatores Vergilii.

It is less easy to conjecture what were the sources of the minute
verbal criticisms on which we dwelt at length in previous pages; but
there is considerable presumption that some of them at least are as old
as Verrius FlaccuS. I have drawn out the following lists with a view of
eliciting the points common to Macrobius with N oniuS, FestuS, Gellius,
Servius, PhilargyriuS, and the Verona scholia.

Macrobius vr iv 2, addita: adfixa et per hoc infesta. Hoc iam
dixerat Lucilius in libro xlv his versibus ‘Si mihi non praetor siet
additus atque agitet me.'

Servius A. vl 90, addans .· est autem verbum Lucilii.

ξ 3. gamit undam .· agmen of a river. These notes are only found
in Macro iuS.

ς 5. Crepitantibusflammzk. Macrobius illustrates only from Lucretius.
Nonius, p. 2 5 5, quotes the passage in Virgil in a note on crepare.

ὅ 6. Ferreus hastis· Horret ager. Macrobius illustr-ates from Ennius.
Serv. A. xl 601: Horret, terribilis est: est autem versus Ennianus
vituperatus a Lucilio dicente per irrisionem, eum debuisse dicere horret
et alget.

Tremulum lumen. Macrobius only.
