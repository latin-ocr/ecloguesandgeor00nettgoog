ΟΝ SOME OF THE EARLY CRITICISMS
OF VIRGIL’S POETRY.

ΤΗΑΤ Virgil was attacked during his life-time for his innovations in style
we are assured by express statements in the memoir by Suetonius After
his death Carvilius Pictor published an Aeneidomastix, on the analogy
of the Homeromastix of ZoiluS, and the Ciceromastix mentioned at the
beginning of the seventh book of Aulus Gellius3 Herennius collected
his vitia, which I suppose means faults os expression, Perellius Faustus
his plagiarisms (furta) ; while an apparently neutral work, called
ὁμοιότητες, or a collection of his translations from the Greek, by Octavius
AvituS, filled eight books.

A reply to the obtrectatores Vergilii was written by Asconius
Pedianus ς a fact which may throw some light on the date of the works
mentioned by Suetonius For Asconius lived in the first part of the first
century Am. ς and if, as it is reasonable from the language of Suetonius
to inser, his work was a reply to the three books of Carvilius Pictor,
Herennius, and Perellius F austuS, it follows that those works cannot
have been published at any very great distance of time from Virgil's
death, which took place in 19 ac.

Ι propose to ask whether it is possible to trace any remains of these
criticismS, and the replies to them, in the notes of Servius ¹ and
Macrobiu5‚ or elsewhere.

And first as to criticisms passed upon Virgil for new combinations
of wordS. Agrippa said that Virgil had been suborned by Maecenas to
invent a new kind of affectation (κακοζηλία), which consisted in an
unusual employment of ordinary wordS,² and was therefore difficult os
detection. With this criticism I am strongly inclined to connect a ·
passage in Horace's Ars Poetica (v. 45 foll.), a work which, as Michaelis³

¹ In the following pagoe, when the name of Servius is mentioned without any
addition, the so·called Vulgate or uninterpolated text of Servius is meant. By
Servius (Dan. ), on the other hand, is meant the Servius edited by Peter Daniel, and
containin the additional notes printed by Thilo (in his recent edition) in italics. The
relation o these notes to those of the Vulgate is discussed below in the section on
Servius.

cacozeliae repertorem, non tumidae nec exilis, sed ex communibus verbis atque ideo
