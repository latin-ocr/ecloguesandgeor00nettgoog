of failing power : and on its transference to Rome, these were at
once developed into the unmistakable symptoms of premature
constitutional decay. What it became afterwards is characteris· ο
tically described in one of Johnson's sarcastic sentences, ‘ At
the revival of learning in Italy,' he says in his life of Ambrose
Philips,¹ ‘it was soon discovered that a dialogue of imaginary
swains might be composed with little difficulty: because the con-

and for images and descriptionS‚ Satyrs and FaunS, and Naiads
and DryadS, were always within call ; and woods, and meadow5,
and hills, and rivers supplied variety of matter, which, having a ·
natural power to soothe the mind, did not quickly eloy it!

the time of Virgil,² for pastoral dulness than for pastoral
ideality, became the poet’s golden land, where imagination

Gradually the pastoral was treated as a sort of exercise-ground
for young authors, who supposed themselveS, in the words of an
old commentator on Spenser‚³ to be ‘ following the example

that be newly crept out of the nest, by little first prove their
tender wings, before they make a greater ssight: It was indeed
little more than the form in which the poet made himself known
to the world, the pseudonym under which it was thought decorous
to veil his real style and title. His shepherds might preserve
their costume‚ but their conversation turned on any thing which
might be uppermost in his own mind, or in that of the public, the
controversies of the Church,⁴ or the death of a royal personage.
It was not to be expected that a thing so purely artificial could
outlive that general questioning of the grounds of poetical excel-
lence, which accompanied the far wider convulsions at the end of
