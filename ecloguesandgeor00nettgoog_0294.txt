side of it and running to a point: the
former seems the more probable, and the
“ duplici dorso '’ of Virg. may only allude
to its position as on each side of the
“buris,” and its support of the two
‘ ⁴ aures.” The plural ‘⁴ dentalia ” is used
by this poet in speaking of one plough,
but it is probably nothing more than a
poetic licence. Hesiod directs the ‘⁶ den·
tale '³ to be made of oak.' Id. According
to Daubeny, the ‘dentale' is a share of
wood, made double by a share of iton
glaced oyer it so as to realize the ‘ duplex
orsum.

173. ‘ Iugum‚' ζυγός, yoke, ‘ a piece of
wood, straight in the middle and curved
towards the ends, which was attached to
the end of the pole of the plough or cart,
and went over the necks of the oxen,
which drew by means of it. 1t was by
the neck the oxen drew.' Keightley.

174. ‘ ‘⁸ Stiva,'' ἑχέτλη, plough-tail‚ or
handle. The “stiva '' was originally
morticed into the ‘⁶ buri5,'' but sometimes
formed one iece with it. It had a cross
piece nam “manicula,” by which the
ξέοιιςέπῖηειῃ held and directed the plough.'

‘fitivaiiue ’ is the reading of all MSS.
[and of Serv.]. Martyn, followed by
Voss, Jahn, Wunderlich, and Schaper,
conjectures ‘ stivae,' which would at once
clear up the sense. But the change wants
authority, and would not improve the
mette, while the MSS. reading is only a
poetical wa of saying the same thing, by
the help o a hendiadys, and is quite in
keeping with Virg.'s love of variety of
expression. The other altemative‚ keep·
ing ‘stivaque,' is to place the comma
after ‘fagus‚’ and take que ' in ‘ alta ue’
as equivalent to ‘ve ’—‘ the light lin en·
tree or tall beech is cut beforehand for
the yoke.' Ribbeck follows Schrader in
placing this line before v. 173, an in-
gerzisous s estion, but not to be admitted

‘Cugrrus’ (so the 3183.) is applied
naturally to a plough in motion, as in
Catull. Lxlv 9 to a ship; a plough, that

is, is a species of cartilage, containing a
‘temo' and a ‘iugum’ at least. Serv.

Before Heius. the reading was ‘exploret ²

nexed to his edition, s. v. ‘ Aratrum,' and
Daubeny, Lect. 3.

husbandry to be learnt; for instance, the
threshing-floor should be made thoroughly
smooth and hard that it may not gape,
and leave room first for weeds and then
sor animals of all kinds)

of their results is given by Keightley.
