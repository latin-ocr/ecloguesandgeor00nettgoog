oN
THE LATER DIDACTIC POETS OF ROME.

HAvmo spoken of the Latin Pastoral writers who came after Virgil, 1
may be expected to say something of his successors in Didactic Poetry.
It is true that the two cases are not parallel: in the former not only the
kind of poetry, but the subject, was the same as Virgil’s own: in the
latter the similarity merely affects the form, and does not extend to the
matter. Like VirgiI, Calpurnius and Nemesianus sang of the contest&
loveS‚ laments of shepherds t unlike Vix-gil, Manilius and Gratius,
Nemesianus and Serenus Sammonicus sing os astronomy and astrology,
of the chase, and os the cure os diseaseS. Here, however, as in the
Introductory Essay to the Georgics‚ I address those who, like myself,
are students os Roman poetry‚ not students os Roman agriculture, so
that I need no apology sor devoting a short time to the examination of
writers whose works resemble the Georgics, as the Georgics themselves

resemble not the treatises of Cato and Varro, but the poems of Lucre—
tius. These writers of course will be themselves considered simply
with reference to their form: to discuss their matter is beyond my
purpose.

The most considerable Latin Didactic poem subsequent to the
Georgics is unquestionably the Astronomica of Manilius. It is divided
into five books, consisting respectively of 926, 970, 682, 935, and 745
lineS, so that its length is nearly double that os Virgil’s work. No
allusion to it occurs in any ancient writers: it is not even quoted by a
single grammarian: indeed, there is no trace of its existence till the
eleventh century, which also happens to be the probable date of its
earliest Ms.; while, on the other hand, its own internal evidence, as
estimated by the most competent critics, would seem to refer it to the
reign of Tiberius.¹ The work is apparently written with that average
command of the hexameter which, aster the example set by Virgil,

¹ [The ‘ Astronomiea’ appears to have been written at the end os Augustus’ reign,
or under Tiberius: the name of the author is uncertain, as ‘ Manilius ’ seems to lack
authority. See Teuffel, 253.]
