Poma quoque( ut primum truncos sensere valentis
et vires habuere suaS, ad sidera raptim
vi propria nituntur opisque haut indiga nostrae.
nec minus interea fetu nemus omne gravescit,

sanguineisque inculta rubent aviaria bacis:

tondentur cytisi, taedas silva alta ministrat,
pascunturque ignes nocturni et lumina fundunt:
et dubitant homines serere atque inpendere curam?

use of the plough and of the ‘ bidens.’ In
the same chapter he gives a precept (5 15),
‘ Nam veteris proverbii meminisse con-
venit Γ. eum, qui aret olivetum, rogare
sructum3 qui stercoret, exorare; qui caedat
(putet) cogere-³

refer understanding it with Benson and
1Ilflmtyn, ‘by this,’ sc. ‘arand0‚' ‘ with
this and this only,’ ‘ this will be enough,'
especially as ‘ pinguem et placitam Paci’
seem to express the effect of ‘nutritor'
(‘nutritor ut pinguis sit,' etc. E. vl 4
note). ‘Do t is, and rear the olive to
the fatness which makes it Peace's darling.’

‘ Nutritor : ’ [the deponent form is quoted
by Nonius, p. 478, from Lucilius: com .
Priscian v111 p. 798, Ρ., Quintil. 1 iv 2 .
Med. and Pal. have ‘ nutritur,' a variant
recognized by the Berne scholia.—H. N.
Neue-Wagener Formenlehre ii p. 67.]

s* 426-428. ‘ Fruit trees t00, when they
have got their strength, take care of
themselves.’

426. The metaphor seems to be from
an adult man feeling his limbs strong
under him. It is carried on through the
rest of the sentence.

427. ‘ Raptim ' = ‘ rapide.' See on 1
409. With the sense comp. vv. 80 foll.

428. ‘ Que ’ eouples the adverbial sub·
stantive with the adverbial adjective.
Comp. A. vl 640, ‘ Largior hic campos
aether et lumine vestit Purpure0.' ‘ Que ’
is omitted by Rom.

(429-457. ‘ Forest treeS, small as well as
great, have their uses 3 men may well take
heart and cultivate them. Nay, they are
even worthier than the vine, which may
be a curse as well as a blessing.'

429. ‘Nec minus : ’ equally with the
trees that have been named.

‘ Interea,’ while man is occupied with
other things; so in the next line ‘ in-
culta’ is emphatic. There seems to be
no reference to the ‘ arbustum ' in ‘ nemus,’
as we might be tempted to suppose from
vv. 308, 323, 401. The word appears to
be used generally of the trees of the forest
in their natural uncultivated state, as man
is afterwards recommended to give them
the benefit of culture.

‘Fetu . . . gravescit:' Lucr. 1 253,
‘ crescunt ipsae fetuque gravantur.'

430. ⁴ Aviaria,’ properly an artificial
place for tarne birds, here the woods.
Comp. Lucr. 1 18, ‘ Frondiferasque domos
avium' sor ‘silvas.'

‘ Sanguineis: ’ such as the elder, E. x

fact comp. E. 1 79.

‘ T aedas‚' torches of pine·wood, so that
‘alta ’ is appropriate.

432. ‘ Pascunturque ignes nocturni et
lumina fundunt ' is a poetical amplification
of ‘taedas ministrat.’ It may be ques·
tioned whether ⁴ ignes ’ means torchlights
or sires. ‘Nocturni ⁹ and ‘lumina ' may
seem to point to the former3 but the
parallel, ‘ Urit odoratam nocturna in
lumina cedrum‚' A. vn 13, apparently
refers to lires, as is shown by their original
Od. v 9. At the same time the eustom
os kin ling fires sor the sake of light by
night (Il. lx 467 soll.) belongs rather to
the heroic age than to Virg.’s day. Comp.
1 291.

433. This line is wanting in Med., and
is omitted by Ribbeck. Its meaning seems
to be z when nature offers so much to the
plantet and cultivator, can man hesitate
to plant and cultivate? Heyne justly sayS,
‘Sententiaversumabsolvens facile excidere
potuit. Versus perse est praeclarus.’ With
the structure comp. A. 1 48, vl 807.
