tum somni dulces densaeque in montibus umbrae.

337· ‘Caeliz’ so Rom. etc„ Sem„ ·

Seneca. That ‘ caeli orbis’ (A. vul 97)
could be used for a planet’s orbit no less
than sor the sun's, appears from 11 477
‘ caeli vias‚' Lucr. v 648 ‘qui minus illa
queant per magnos aetheris orbis Aestibus
inter se diversis sidera ferri.' Med. and
Probus have ‘ cae10,’ and so Ribbeck and
others ε it is slightly supported by Catull.
Lxu 20 ‘ Hespere, qui caelo fertur cru-

delior ignis 2 '

‘ Ignis Cylleniu5,’ Mercury, called by
the Greeks ὀ στίλβων. ‘ Ignis ' is doubt-
less contrasted with ‘frigida' in v. 336.

338. Ceres is distinguished from the
other gods to show that she in particular
is to be worshipped.

‘Magnae,’ an ordinary epithet of the
{23⁵⁹ applied to Jupiter, Apollo, Jun0,

es», etc.

⁸ Annua sacra ’ are the Ambarvalia,
mentioned before, E. v 70 (note), and
described at length Tibull. 11 1.

339. ⁴ Refer ’ might express recurrence ;
see v. 249. But here it seems to denote
the payment of a due, as A. v 605.

‘ OperatuS‚' sacrificing‚ like ‘ facio ' (E.
111 77), ῥέζω. ‘ Tunc operata Deo pubes
discumbet in herba‚' Tibull. 11 v 95. For
the present force of the part. see vv. 206,
291111οἀ. originally had ‘ orbis,’ which was
altered first into ‘herbis,’ then into ‘arbis‚'
i.e. ‘arvis‚' the reading of some inferior
co ies,

ι340. The language is not to be pressed,
as the Ambarvalia did not take place till
the end of April. ⁸ Casum,' end, contains
a sense of ‘ cadere,’ which is generally ex·
pressei? by ⁴ occidere.' Rom. and Gud.
corr. ave ‘ casu.’

341. τῆμος πιόταταί τ’ αἶγες καὶ οἴνας
ἄριστος, Hes. Works 585, speaking of
summer. ‘ Pingues’ doubtless refers to
fatness either for sacrifice or for eating,
as the mention of wine shows.

‘Mollissimaz ' so ‘ molli mer0,’ Hor.
Od. 1 vii 19, ‘molle Calenum,’ Juv. 1 69,
‘ mellow,’ Greek μαλακός as opposed to
σκλιῖρός (‘ durum Bacchi saporem,’ 1v
102 .

342. The second clause explains the
first. Hesiod l. c. wishes sor a seat under
the shadow of a rock.

343. [‘ Tibi ς ’ the dat. resembles those

in E. vu 7, 9, x 33; G. 11 ²983 A. v1
11311411ζέῐὲῒῖὴο 1,(ῗέἒὲἑέἐῖὲὲεῇ “dese as ‹givseg
pronoun, ‘tuas' etc. But here ‘ ubi’ might
be a {lan of the person interested, Roby
1150.

344. Libations of honey, milk, and
wine are to be made to Ceres Macrob.
Sat. 111 11, explaining this passage, says
that the mixture was called ‘mulsum'
He also com . ιν 102, and explains
‘miti ’ here o the wine as corrected by
the honey; but this is needless after
‘ mollissima,‘ preceding.

It is not clear why Virg. direets this
ffissfssicssff offzring. tCato εἷξκῐέ deidectts

ore arves wine 0 er o
Ceres with the entrails of the sacrifice,
but he says nothing os other liquids.
Mi1k, wine, and honey formed part of the
Greek offerings to the dead (Aesch. Pers,
611, Odyss. xl 27); and the Greek
Demeter was connected with the lower
world (Miiller’s Diss. on the Eumenides,
§g 80 foll.). Daphnis at the Ambarvalia
is to have milk and oil (the latter being
part of the funeral libations, and occa·
sionally offered to Demeter, Miiller, §89),
and also wine (E. v 67 foll. ). Theocr. v
53 foll. makes milk and oil offered to the
nymphS, milk and honey to Pan: and
Macrob. 1. c. says that on December 21
‘ mulsum ' was offered to the Panes.

Serv, mentions an interpretation which
coupled ‘Baccho ’ with ‘ cui 3 ' but ‘ miti ’
