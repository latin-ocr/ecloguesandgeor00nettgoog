x PREFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.

what 1 think will be admitted to be improved types. The net
result of these various changes is a slight decrease in the size os
the volume.

I am unwilling to close this preface without bearing witness
to the heavy loss which Latin scholarship sustained by Mr.
Nettleship's death. 1 have tried elsewhere to estimate his worth
—in the Classical Review—and Professor Bywater has done it
far better in the Dictionary os National Biography. My own
' debt to him, as pupil and as friend, has been very great in Latin
scholarship. 1 can only regret that he did not live to give to this
volume that thorough revision which 1 have no doubt he would

’ have given.

1 have to thank my friend Mr. G. E. Marindin for reading a
large part os the proofs and helping me to many very real
improvements.
