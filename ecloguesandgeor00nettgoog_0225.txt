EXTREMUM hunc, Arethusa, mihi concede laborem:
pauca meo Gallo, set quae legat ipsa LycoriS,
carmina sunt dicenda: neget quis carmina Gallo?
sic tibi, cum fluctus subterlabere Sicanos,
Doris amara suam non intermisceat undam, 5
incipe; sollicitos Galli dicamus amoreS,
dum tenera attondent simae virgulta capellae.
non canimus surdis.; respondent omnia silvae.

Quae nemora, aut qui vos saltus habuere, puellae

1-8. ‘ Mylast pastoral strain is in honour
of Gallus ε l sing os his love with my goats
about me in the wood.'

1. ‘ Arethusa' was conventionally the
paetoral fountain, Mosch. 111 78, and as
such apparently is invoked by the d ‘ng
DaphniS, Theocr. 1 117. She is ere
addressed as a Muse might be, like the
⁴ Nymphae Libethrides,’ vn 21.

‘ Concede laborem,’ like ‘ carmen con-
cedite,’ vu 22. ‘ Laborem ’ as in G. 11
39. He asks to be allowed to elaborate
one song more. Pal. originally had ‘ la-
borum,’ which Ribbeck arbitrarily adopts.

2. Wagn., followed by Forb„ connects
this line with the preceding, placing a
period at ⁴ Lycoris! This change seems
plainly sor the worse, as ‘meo Gallo’
would come awkwardly aster ‘ mihi‚’ while
‘ pauca ’ evidently refers to ⁸ carmina!

‘ Set quae ’ is the antithesis to ‘ pauoe,'
‘though few, they must be such as may

att raet even her scomful eye. ’ [⁶ Set' Med. ’

Pan—H. N.]

4. ⁴ Sic ' followed by ‘ incipe,’ as in lx

o- 2.

3 ‚ffhe legend of the union between
Arethusa and Alpheus recurs A. 111 694
foll.‚ and is the subject of what remains
os Moschus' eighth Idyl, vv. 4, 5 os which
Virg. seems to have imitated: καὶ βαθὺς
ἐμβαίνει τοῖς cupam, τὴν ’δὲ θάλασσαν
Νερθεν ὑποτροχάει, κού μίγνυται ὕδασιν
ὕδωρ. Alpheus in the legend is the pur-
suing lover3 here Virg. ap rently con·
templates them as reconcile , and passing
to and fro to visit each other, and prays
Arethusa to assist his tale os love, if she
would have the course of her own love
run smooth.

5. ‘Dori5‚’ wife of Nereus and mother
of the Nereids (HeS. Theog. 240), is here
put for the sea, perhaps, as Heyne sug-
gestS, aster some Alexandrian poet, like
Amphitrite, the wife of Neptune, Hom.

Od. ΧΠ 60, 97 (referred to by Voss),
Thetis, E. ιν 32. ‘Amara’= ‘salsa,'
with which it is coupled G. 11 238.

6. ‘ Sollicitus ’ is an epithet of love here
and in Ov. Her. xvnl 196, ofalover Hor.
Od. 111 vii 93 so ‘cura' is a common
synonym of ‘ amor.’

7. ‘ Simae capellae‚’mpae' ἔριφοι, Theocr.
v111 50. ‘virgulta,’ note on G. 11 2.
The goats browse while the goatherd
sm? ‘8136ss ganizmus surdis,’ like ‘ non in-
iussa cano,' vl 9. ‘We are not singing
to deaf ears.' There is an allusion, as
Erum. remarkS, to the proverbial ‘surdo
can3e3’19r ‘ 1s-Iurdto narrare fffulanlig’ Livy
xi. , er. au. 11 ι ιο, or. .p. 11 ι
200.
‘ Respondere' takes an acc. of the
answer made. Here it has the wider
sense of ‘ reddere ' or ‘ referre,’ to repeat
or give back. Comp. Ov. M. Χι 52,
‘flebile lingua Murmurat exanimis: re·
spondent flebile ripae,’ and for the general
sense ‘ resonare doces Amaryllida silvas‚'
ι .
59-30. ‘ Why were not the nymphs pre·
sent when their favourite lay dying? All
nature mourned sor him ε his sheep grieved
for their master: the swains came to visit
him: Apollo was there, and Silvanus and
Pan, bidding him leave brooding to no
end over blighted hopes)

9. This and the three following lines
are from Theocr. 1 66 foll.‚ where the
nymphs are naturally mentioned in con-
nexion with Daphnis, who, according ιο
Id. vn 92, was married to a Naiad.
Here, as in v. 1, they seemed to play the
part of the MuseS, and are consequently
associated with ParnassuS, Pindus, and
Aganippe. This connects them not only
with GalluS, but with Virg., who had ’ust
addressed Arethusa, and at the end ο his
song, v. 70, turns to them again.
