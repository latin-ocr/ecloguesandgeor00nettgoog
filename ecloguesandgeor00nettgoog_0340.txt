232 P. VERGILI MARONIS

flore piri, glandemque sues fregere sub ulmis
Nec modus inserere atque oculos inponere simplex.
nam, qua se medio trudunt de cortice gemmae
et tenuis rumpunt tunicaS, angustus in ipso
fit nodo sinus; huc aliena ex arbore germen
includunt, udoque docent inolescere libro,
aut rursum enodes trunci resecantur, et alte
finditur in solidum cuneis via, deinde feraces
plantae immittuntur: nec longum tempuS, et ingens 80
exiit ad caelum ramis felicibus arbos
miraturque novas frondes et non sua poma.
Praeterea genus haut unum‘ nec fortibus ulmisJ

certain what this tree is3 the usual opinion
is that it is the “sorbus aucuparia,’' our
quicken or mountain ash. As this how-

“ornus ” a “fraxinus silvestris,'' distin·
ished from the other ashes by havin

roader leaves, botanists are now incline&
to think it is the “fraxinus rotundifolia '’ of
Lamarck, the manna tree‚ or tree that
yields the manna, of Calabria)

The words ‘incanuit albo flore ' are to
be taken with both clauses.

73-82. ⁸ Grasting is distinct from inocu-
lation ε in the latter case you introduce a
bud, in the former a slip.’ [See Palladius
⁴ de Insitione’ and Col. Arb. 26.—H. N.]

73. ‘ Nec modus inserere :’ see on 1
21 .
²3Oculos inponere,’ to inoculate or bud,
ἑνοφθαλμισμός. In what follows inocula-
tion is distinguished from engrafting. We
must therefore take ‘ simplex ’ as= ⁴ unus '
(comp. v. 4823 so ‘ duplex' frequently:
‘duo ). ‘The mode of grafting and in·
oculating is not one.’ It is possible that
Virg. may mention the two species first as
constitutin a genus, and afterwards as the
varieties o the genus which they consti-
tute, though this seems clumsy. Mr.
Blackhurn supposes Virg. to mean that
there are more ways than one of grafting
and budding, and then, after giving one
way of budding, to pass on, without
describing another, to grafting—a prefer·
enee of literary variety to logical arrange·
ment which would not be un·Virgilian.
In the whole context Vi .'s object is to
show the manifoldness offiis subject. See
above, vv. 63 soll„ below, vv. 83 fou.

75. ‘ Tunicas,’ that which is under the
‘ cortex) Pliny xx1v 7, xvr 65.

76. ⁸ Fit,’ is made by the knife. ‘ Huc

78. ‘ Rursum,’ on the other hand.
Comp. Hor. Ep. 1 ii 17, ‘ Rursus quid
virtus et quid sapientia possit Utile pro-

(Α. 11 229, 232) aud once in Hor. (Sat. 11
iii 268) for metrical reasons: see E. x 62]

79. ‘ F eraces plantae, ’ slips from fruitful
trees·

80. ‘ Et’=‘ curn : ’ comp. A. 111 9,
‘ Vix prima inceperat aestas», Et pater
Anchises dare fatis vela iubebat ; ’ [11 692,
‘ vix ea fatus erat, subitoque fragore in·
tonuit‚’ and often in Virg. and in writers
aster him. Con. calls it ‘a temnant of

ff (47⁸7, 494), butyit seems not to occur‘igni
earlier Latin. For a similar use of ‘ atque '
= ‘ even as,' see 11 402]

81. ‘ Exiit :’ ou the quantity of the final
⁶ i' see p. 283. The perfect expresses
instantaneousness; see 1 49.

82. SerV. gives ‘ miratastque, ’ apparently
as corr. for [some unmetrical reading
which he does not quote. Med. had ori·
ginally ‘ mirataeque ’ (according to Hoff-
mann), corr. to ‘ miratastque,' and much
later to, ⁴ miraturque.’ Gud. has ‘ mirata

of tree, olive, apple, pear, and especially
in the vine, the diversities of which are
innumerabl e. ’
