legions (Mommsen, HermeS, xix 13),
and provincials may thus have received
land in 41. ‘ Barbarus' has, there·

should be taken equally precisely to mean
stained with civil war). A fourth century

Ribbeck’s cursives. Rom. has ‘ agriS,’ its
original reading having been ‘ consue·
vimus agris?

It seems best to take the words as an
exclamation, expressing the result of ‘ en
quo produxit:’ these are the men for
whom we have sown.

this before you, go on doing as you
have done.' Grafting pears and plant·

described in G. 11. ‘Insere, Daphni,

78. ‘Cytisus ' is the arborescent lucerne,
which is common in Greece and Italy,
and a favourite food of cattle and bees.
Comp. 1164, x 30, etc. Keightley remarks
that as the cytisus and sallows are plants
of the plain, we may suppose that a dif-
ferent rural scene from the former is in-
tended. Where, however, we see Greek
ancl Italian scenery mixed, we may be

apples, chestnutS, and cheese. The smoke
announces supper, and the evening is
setting in.’ “

79. ⁶ Poteras' (similarly used in Hor.
S. 11 i 16, Ov. M. 1 679) has been explained
as though Meliboeus were moving off
(com . ν. 75) ; but it is rather to be com-
ἕως with ‘ tempus erat ' (‘ nunc Saliari-

us Ornare pulvinar deorum Tempus erat
dapibus, sodales‚’ Hor. od. 1 xxxvii 2). It
seems more pressing than the present—
‘ you might as well stay.' Perhaps the
account of the idiom is that it treats the
time for action as almost gone, the wrong
determination as almost formed, and so
implies urgency. [Roby, 1535] Tibull.
111 tvi §3 has ‘longas tecum requiescere
noc ες.

The old reading was ⁶ poteris ’ and
‘hac nocte,’ but ‘ poteris’ is found only
in Π, and the strongest support for ‘ nocte ’
is Π and a correction in Pal„ which
changes ‘ noctem ’ into ⁴ nocte,’ but leaves
‘ hanc ' unalterecl.
