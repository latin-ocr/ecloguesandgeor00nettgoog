P. VERGILI MARONIS

aeternum frangenda bidentibus; omne levandum 400

fronde nemus

redit agricolis labor actus in orbem,

atque in se sua per vestigia volvitur annus,

ac iam olim seras posuit cum vinea frondes

frigidus et silvis aquilo decussit honorem,

iam tum acer curas venientem extendit in annum 405

distinction to be meant, Virg. will be
speaking os the two kinds of vineyards,
calculated roepectively sor ploughing and
digging: see on v. 355.

‘Scindere’ is commonly used of the
plough, 1 50, 111 160. Col. iv 4 says
that the number os times the soil ought to
be loosened cannot be defined—the more
the better.

401. ‘ Nemus’ like ‘silvis‚’ v. 404, and
perhaps ‘ umbra‚’ v. 410, seem to be used
of the supporting trees in the ‘ arbustum,’
as in v. 308 above. ‘ Labor actus’ may
be taken with Heyne and others of past
labour, the same tasks recurring yearly3
or ‘actus' may be connected with ‘in
orbcm‚’ moving in a ring. In vv. 516
soll. we have the other side of the picture,
the constant succession of the fruits of the
husbandman’s toil.

402. ‘ Atque :’ even as. The copula·
tive is employed here in the place os a
conjunction denoting a more special rela-
tion. This use is commonest where the
relation intended is that of time [11 80
note]. Comp. the use os ‘atque' in
coniparisons, and in such expressions as
‘ simul atque.'

‘ Volvitur-:⁹ Varius had said of the
world ‘ sua se volventis in vestigia’ (sab.
ine. 1, Ribbeck).

403. polim cum ’= ⁸ illo tempore cum,'
used by Plaut. Lucr. etc. Comp. e.g.
Trin. 11 iv 122 ‘primum oninium, olim
terra quom proscinditur, In quinto quoque
sulco moriuntur boves;’ Lucr. vt 1483
A. vm 391, G. 111 303; ‘olim ’ is usually
explained as having here its etymological
meaning, ‘ then, (when).' Con.‚ who hesi·
tated about this line, objects that the phrase
‘ appears to becommonly used forindefinite,
not sor definite occurrences,' which is true,
but the present assage is just what he
means by an iudei-inite occurrence ; comp.
the passage from the Trin.]

404. 'sbis line is borrowed from Varro
Atacinus, according to Serv. Horace has
the same phrase, perhaps from the same
source, Epod. xl 6, ‘ December silvis
honorem decutit.’

405. Med. has ‘ extendet!

406. ‘ Rusticus ε’ Rom. has ‘agricola.’

‘Curvo Saturni dente:’ Saturn was
regularly represented with a pruning-imile.
{lum x¹11 39 (see Mayor's note) represents
“1:32 ῗῑξῗιῗῒέἓῖἒὲ 3 ‘1222‘51 ΣΒὲᾱ ῙῗζῗΒέἓῖ
curved implement (v. 423).

‘ Relictam ' may be either ‘ stripped os
its foliage ’ (for which however it is diffi-
cult to hnd an exact parallel), or, as Serv.
takes it, the vine which he has left, in
other words ‘ he returns to the vine-³

407. ‘ Persequitur‘ like ‘insectabere '
of exterminating weeds, 1 155, ‘insequi-
tur' of following u sowing by levelling
the soil, ib. 105. t is conceivable how-
ever that Virg. may have wished to imi-
tate the Greek use of διατελεῖν with a
participle.

‘Fingit ξ’ comp. ᾼ. V1 βο, “fingitque
εἴξιᾞεέἶέεςίῐὲἶῗξᾞξεὲ οὲοςὶξξ ιῑὶινοιιιιιίσάεὲ Ιῗξ
the potter. Comp. Pers. 111 24, ⁸ Nunc,
nunc properandus et acri Fingendus sine
fine rota, and the word ‘ figulus.’

‘ Putando : ’ Col. (iv 4) includes under
this term the ‘ablaqueatio,’ which con·
sisted in laying open the roots and cutting
away all suckers springing from them
within a soot and a half ol' the sursace.
Cerda however understands ‘ attondeus’
here of ‘ ablaqueatiO.'

408. Digging was constantly to go on,
so that he that began first would do best:
carting away and burning the branches
