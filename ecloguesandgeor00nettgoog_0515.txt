DIDACTIC POETS OF ROME. 407

by the motion of the universe, a perfect and symmetrical form without
beginning or end, resembling that of the gods. Hence it is that all the
stars are not visible from all parts of the earth. Being spherical, the
earth has two poles, north and south. Tbese are visited alternately by
the sun, so that it is day with one part of mankind while it is night
with another. And this fourfold universe is governed by one divine
intelligence.

Proceeding to details, he speaks of the zodiacal signs in their order,
contenting himself with enumerating and briefly discriminating them.
Then follows a long muster-roll of the northern constellationS, extending
over nearly a hundred lineS. Seventy lines carry us through a similar
review of the southern hemisphere: and a much briefer paragraph
speaks of certain signs which, though completely invisible, are con-
cluded to exist from analogy. Such is the host of heaven, a mere
mixed multitude to look at, yet governed by unerring laws. ‘ Quid
tam confusum specie, quid tam vice certum est ? ' This regularity is,
in fact, the surest witness to the existence of a supreme intelligence.
When Troy was taken by the Greeks, Arctos and Orion were opposed
- to each other as they are now. Ages have rolled on, retribution has
come upon Greece, yet the face of heaven is the same, unchanging, and
therefore divine. Forty lines are given to the Arctic and Antarctic
circleS, the Tropics, and the Equator: thirty to the Colures: thirty
more to the Meridian and the Horizon. The Zodiac and Galaxy follow,
the latter suggesting a number of inquiries, mythological and philoso-
phical, culminating in a theory that it is inhabited by the souls of the ’
heroes, the chief of whom are enumerated at a somewhat tedious length.
The planets are despatched in four lines: the comets receive a longer
commemoration, which closes with a passage evidently modelled on the
conclusion of the First Georgic, about· their effects on mankind and on
the empires of the world. Comets‚ we are told, portend plagues‚ like
that of Athens, when medicine gave way, funeral fires failed, and a great
nation perished‚ scarcely leaving an heir behind it; disasterS, as when
Germany turned on Varus and shed the blood of three Roman legions ;
civil warS, like the battle of Philippi, waged on ground yet heaving
with newly-buried corpses. A brief prayer to the gods that these

struggles rlnay be the last that Rome is destined to undergo terminates
the book.

¹ In taking leave of Manilius, 1 will venture to suggest an emendation of his text.
The passage is in Book 1, v. 245, ‘Nos in nocte sumus, somnosque in membra
locamus-³ Scaliger reads ‘somno sic,' Stober ‘somno qui.’ 1 should prefer ‘ voca·
mus.' The words are confused Lucr. v 12, where ‘vocavit ’ of the MSS. has been
corrected by the editors into ‘ locavit!
