P. VERGILI MARONIS

arboris obnixus trunco ventosque lacessit
ictibus et sparsa ad pugnam proludit harena.

post, ubi collectum robur viresque resectae,

235

signa movet, praecepsque oblitum fertur in hostem;
fluctus uti medio coepit cum albescere ponto
longiu3‚ ex altoque sinum trahit; utque volutus
ad terras immane sonat per saxa, neque ipso
monte minor procumbit; at ima exaestuat unda 240
verticibuS, nigramque alte subiectat harenam.

Omne adeo genus in terris hominumque ferarumque,
et genus aequoreum, pecudeS, pictaeque volucreS,

233. ‘Obnixus,' butting, as in v. 222.
‘ Ventos: ’ so ‘ ventilare ’ is used of asencer's
flourishes (Lemaire). Comp.A.v 77 note.

234. ‘ Iam cornu petat et ‘bus qui
spargat harenam‚’ Ε. 111 87. [‘ Proludit :’
comp. Cic. De Or. 11 lxxx 325 and Dio.
Verr. 47 glluV. v 263 Seneca de Ira 11 ii
5. Η. 121. , ι ‚

⁸ Receptae ' (Rom., Gud. corn), was the
reading before Heins.

236. See v. 212. [‘Oblicum’ Med. for
⁴ oblitum.’—H. N.]

237. Virg. shows his judgment by call-
ing ofl' the reader’s attention to a simile,
instead of followin the animals throu h a
second encounter. gl'he comparison is rom
11. ιν 422 soll„ where the thin illustr-ared
is the march os the Greeks. {t recurs in
a briefer form A. vn 528 foll„ where the
quarrel with the Italian rustics is swelling
into a battle. Here probably the likeness is
in the roar as well as the rush of the water.
With regard to the latter, two points are
evidently meant to be noted,-the a
ance in the distance and the final col ision.

‘ Uti medio ' (Rom. Pal.) preferred by
Wagn. on the ground that Virg. omits the

‘gg‘ when hgagis‘est “medearis” loosely.
.am. r. uinm 10.

238. Thep construction is ‘ uti fluctus,
cum coepit albescere, trahit,' ‘ cum coepit '
answering to ‘volutus’in the next part of
the sentence. Heyne and Wagn. are right
in making ‘ ue couple ⁸ ex alto ’ with
‘ longius. T e combination is Virgilian,
resembling those noticed on A. v 498, but
more grammaticaily regular. See Wagn.
Q.‘ng3:l.to’‚ ‘ from the main sea) answer·
ing to ‘medio pont0.' ‘ Omnis ab alto

Frangitur inque sinus scindit sese unda re-
duct05,’ A. 1 160. ‘ Sinus' here is the
curve os the wave, asin ιν 362.

‘ Trahit ’ expresses not only forward
motion but the gradual increase of the
‘sinus.’ ‘ thue is parallel to ‘uti.’

239. ‘Ipso monte z ’ the ‘ mons ’ being
the whole of which the ⁴ saxum ’ is a part.
‘ Saxum, Haud partem exiguam montis,’
A. x 127. Here ‘mons’ is probably the
crag against which the sea breaks. The
same comparison occurs iv 361, A. 1 105.

241. ‘ Subiectatz' Lucr. vt 700, ‘Saxa-
que subiectare, et harenae tollere nimbos,’
which Virg. plainly imitated. ⁶ subvectat ⁷
(Med. and Rom.) does not suit the sense,
being used os carrying sreights, upheaving
burdenS, etc.

‘ Harenam ’ is the sand at the bottom
which the sea casts up, the κελαινὰν θῖνα
καὶ δυσάνεμον, beaved up βυσσόθεν, of
Soph. Ant. 590. Comp. A. 1 107, ‘ furit
aestus harenisss where the same thing is
described. ‘ Like a billow, when, be·
ginning to whiten sar away in the mid sea,

pear- 11 draws up from the main its bellying

curve; like it too, when, rolling to the
shore, it roars terrific among the rocks,
and bursts, in bulk as hugeas their parent
cliff, while the water below boils up in
soaming eddiae, and discharges from its
depths the murky sarid)

242-283. ⁸ In fact, the maddening effects
of passion are universal, but none undergo
so much as mares?

242. ‘Adeot’ see on Ε. lv 11.

243. ‘ Pecudes, pictaeque volucres,' A.
1¹:303. ..Rauen-..21⁶3 aar&
that word might easily be pressed so as to
include all quadrupeds, as might ‘ pecudes ’
itsels (A. vx 728).
