which has been extensively cultivated in later timeS‚ and may be
said to have flourished in England down to the end of the last
century. Yet· it is not too much to assert that a critic who
wished to justify the disfavour with which didactic poetry is re-
garded by the writers and readers of the present day might find
his strongest arguments in an examination os Hesiod’s poem, not
by attempting to derogate from its characteristic excellenceS, but
by using it as a witness to show that the class of compositions of
which it is a specimen was not calculated for permanence. Colonel
Mure is not exceeding his customary modesty of theorizing when
he delivers it as his opinion that ‘had prose composition been
already popular in Hesiod’s time, the Works and Days would
probably have been embodied in that form? 1t is indeed
obviously the product of a time when verse was the one mode of
formal composition, recommending itself to the reader's memory
by its portability‚ and to the writer’s imagination‚ as differing
most from that common every-day speech which it must have
seemed impossible to invest with any artistic associationS.
Hesiod doubtless was sensible of the pleasures of a composer‚
and sought for such graces os imagery and style as lay within his
horizon: but his first object was to enunciate those practical
rules which he regarded as necessary to the conduct of life in an
agricultural community. But after prose writing had come to be
studied, didactic poetry os this kind was no longer possible. It
might linger on among the uneducated: but among the culti·
vators of composition as an art, those who wished really to
instruct were sure to write in prose. Theophrastus took the
place of Hesiod by the same law which gave the chair of
Xenophanes and Empedocles to Plato and Aristotle. The
Hesiodic form however remained after its spirit had passed
elsewhere. The union of practical teaching with the charms of
versification continued to be attempted by writers who sorgot to
ask themselves under what circumstances that union had first
been realized. It was easy to produce something more sys-
{ematic than the Works and DayS, while the discovery of images
appropriate to rural life, yet not unsuited to the dignity of the
Muse‚ furnished a sufficient employment to the poet’s fancy.
