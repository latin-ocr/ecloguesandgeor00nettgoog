BUCOLICA. ECL. IX.

M. Id quidem ago et tacituS‚ Lycida, mecum ipse volut0,
si valeam meminisse3 neque est ignobile carmen.
‘ Huc adeS, o Galatea; quis est nam ludus in undis?

hic ,ver purpureum, varios hic flumina circum

40

fundit humus θοι-εδ, hic candida· populus antro
imminet, et lentae texunt umbracula vites;
huc ades; insani feriant sine litora fluctus!

L. Quid„ quae te pura solum sub nocte canentem

audieram? numeros memini, si verba tenerem.

M. ‘ Daphni, quid antiquos signorum suspicis ortus?

37·43. ‘M. 1 am trying to recollect.
Here are some lines in which he asks
Galatea to leave the sea, and come on
shore and enjoy the glories of spring.’

37. ‘ Id agere ' is a common phrase for
being busy about an object, as in the well·
known expression ‘ hoc age‚' the same
sense doubtless which appears in the com-
mon use of the imperative ‘ age,' though
in the Greek dyc, from which it obviously
comes, the notion must be that of leading
or going along with.

38. ‘ Si valeam,' in the hope that, ,like
‘ si forte,’ vr 57, A. 11 756.

‘ Neque ’ here gives the reason why he
is trying to recollect the verseS, like ‘ et '
A. x1 901.

39. Condensed from· Theocr. xl 42
foll. Galatea is addressed as in vu 37.

For the interposition os a word between
‘qais ' and ‘ nani' see on G. lv 445.

‘ Ludus in undis:’ comp. Theocr. xl
62, ὥς κεν ἴδω τί ποχ’ ἁδὺ κατοικῆν τὸν
βυθὸν ὔμμιν.

4ο. ⁴ Purpureum,’ v 38 note ; red may
be meant as the rominent colour of
. blooming flowerS, li e ‘vere rubenti,’ G.
11 319. Theocr. xvm 27 has λευκὸν ἔαρ.
[‘ Sunny.'—-·H. N.]

41. ‘ Candida populus ’ (⁶ alba ’ Hor.
Od. 11 iii 9), λεύκη being the Greek
name.

‘Antro' carries us back to Polyphemus
and his cave in Theocr. xl 44.

42. Pal. originally had ‘ e ’ sor ‘ et,’
whence Ribbeck gratuitously reads ‘ en.’

Whether the vine grows over the cave,
as in v 6, or forms a bower of itself, is
not clear. ‘ Umbraculaz’ ‘prope aream
faciundum umbracula, quo succedant
homines in aestu tempore meridian0,’
Varro, R. R. 1 51.

43. ‘ Insani,' ‘ the wild waves’ play ’ on

the shore, is contrasted with the quiet
beauty os the land, that Galatea may give
the latter the preference. [Bentley on
Luoen 11 673 suggests ‘incani' here and
⁸ incanis ' for Ovid's ‘ obrutus insanis esset
adulter aqui5,’ Her. 1 6.]

44, 45. ‘L. What os that song os his 1
11ςαῖιά you singing to yourself the other
ωε44. ‘ Quid, quae‚’ like the common
phrase ‘quid, quod.' ⁸ What do you say to
those verses? ’ [introducing a new topicJ.

‘Pura sub nocte: ² comp. G. 11 364
note. The clearness of the night is doubt-
less mentioned because Moeris sang in the
{ffieassigar‘hsiss 2¹2³} ma “ssffssgsffie
Forb. well comp. Lucr. 1 142, ‘inducit
noctes vigilare serenas.'

45. ‘1 remember the tune, if Ι only
had the words.' [⁶ Numeri ' is explained
by Quint. lx iv 054, and Serv. on A. vl
645 as=‘rhythmi, soni,’ and here as:
⁸ metra vel rhythmos.' 1t seems to mean
the air and the rhythm, which would
probably, in ancient music, be inseparably
connected.—H. N.]

In the construction ‘ memini—si tene-
rem,’ the conditional clause is not logic-
ally connected with the other, but with
something understood, e.g. it might be
‘ numeros memini, et carmen ipsum revo-
carem, si verba tenerem.' We may com·
pare the use os ‘ si ' to express a wish.

46·55. ‘M The Julian is the star of
stars: it will tell us when to sow, plant,
and grast. Memory sails me, memory,
that was once so good, and voice too:

but Menalcas will gratify you himself!
46. Ribbeck, following Med. and Gud.,
continues vv. 46-50 to Lycidas, who is
supposed to recollect what he was trying
vainly to recover. But the ordinary
