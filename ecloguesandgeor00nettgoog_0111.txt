INTRODUCTION. 3

the last century. Whether it is now to be registered as an extinct
species, at least in England‚ is perhaps a question of language
rather than of fact. The poetry of external nature has been
wakened into new and intenser life, and the habits of the country
are represented to us in poems‚ reminding us of the earliest and
best days of the Idyl: but the names of Eclogue and Pastoral
are heard no longer, nor is it easy to conceive of a time when the
associations connected with them are likely again to find favour
with Englishmen.

For this corruption probably no writer is so heavily charge·
able as Virgil. Changes of the kind, it is true, are attributableas
much to the general condition of the intellectual atmosphere as
to any individual source of infection ; the evil too had begun, as
has been already remarked‚ before pastoral poetry had migrated
from Syracuse. But in Virgil it at once attained a height which
left comparatively little to be done by subsequent writerS, though
their inferiority in the graces of expression was sure to render the
untruthfulness of the conception more conspicuous, They might
make their poetical Arcadia, to borrow again the words of
Johnson,¹ still more ‘ remote from known reality and speculative
possibility' ε but it was scarcely in their power to confound
worse the confusion which blended Sicily and the ·Mantuan
district into one, and identified Julius Caesar with that Daphnis
whom the nymphs loved, and whose death drew groans from the
lions.

There is something almost unexampled in the state of feeling
which at Rome, and in the Augustan age in particular, allowed
palpable and avowed imitation to claim the honours of poetical
originality. Pacuvius and Accius are praised not for having
called out the tragedy which lies, patent rather than latent,
in Roman history and Roman life, nor even for having made the
legends which they derived from Greece the subject of original
dramas of their own, but specifically for having applied ² their wit
