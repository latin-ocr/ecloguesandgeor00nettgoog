VIRGIL AND HIS ANCIENT CRITICS. xlv

v vii 7 z Aen. v 487 : Servius is silent.

On Aen. v 7405 νι 214, 232; vn 197, 1983 vm 560; lx 18, 138,
146, 308, 7823 x 4673 xl 191, Servius is silent; but he agrees with
Macrobius in noticing Aen. vl 278 (Dan.), 362 (where he quotes another
line, Iliad 1 4), 595 (Dan.), 6253 vn 14, 699 (Dan.); vm 182, 455
(Dan), 589 (Dan.); 1x 397, 319, 32803211), 459 (Dan·>; x 279 (Dan.);
xl 4843 1x 435 (Dan.)

So far we have seen that Servius omits some, but notices many of
the passages quoted by Macrobius 3 but on the following passages he or
his ancient interpolator have notes which are not found in Macrobius :
Aen· ῙῙ 72 278, 503, 6043 ῙῙῙ 98, 138, ²467 590² 6²32 635, 6783 lv 33,
367, 496, 613, 647; v 1, 85, 468, 487, 556, 594; v1 1, 56, 251, 436,
468, 532, 650, 894; vu 1, 20, 26, 225, 282, 550, 6413 vul 250, 274,
4613 1x 1, 106, 264, 269, 348, 359, 437, 592, 799, 767, 894, x 115, 361,
488, 842, 9005 xl 90, 101, 183, 381, 492, 664, 739, 8633 xn 84, 102,
116,142,206,212,266‚309,546,691,725‚896,908,952.

These lists are sufficient to show the minute diligence with which
Virgil’s translations from Homer had been hunted up. With regard to
Servius and MacrobiuS, they tend, I think, to support the hypothesis
which I have already put forward (p. xxxii), that neither of these com-
mentators is borrowing from the other, but that both are drawing on
common sources, These sources may very probably have been the

ὁμοιότητες of Octavius AvituS, and the furta of Perellius F austuS, or
extracts from both.

V.

The sixth book of the Saturnalia opens with a collection of passages
borrowed by Virgil from Latin poets, Ennius, LuciliuS‚ LucretiuS, and
others. The introductory remarks have the air of a reply to some
hostile observations such as may, perhapS, have been made by Perel-
lius Faustus in his collection of furta. ‘ Etsi vereor ne dum ostendere
cupio quantum Vergilius noster ex antiquiorum lectione profecerit, et
quos ex omnibus flores vel quae in carminis sui decorem ex diversis
ornamenta libaverit, occasionem reprehendendi vel imperitis vel malignis
ministrem, exprobrantibus tanto viro alieni usurpationem, nec consideran·
tibus hunc esse fructum legendi, aemulari ea quae in aliis probes, ete.’

Comparing Servius and Macrobius on this point also, we find that
none of the passages touched upon in the first chapter of the sixth book
of the Saturnalia are noticed by ServiuS, except Aen. 1 530, lx 422
(Dan.), 528 (Dan.), xn 552. In the second chapter Lucretius and
Virgil are compared in detail. Servius' notes (which only mention
the fact of the borrowing) correspond on Georg. 111 287, and on the
passage at the end of the third Georgic describing the pestilence:
but in ἕξ 15 and onward come a number 0f passages on which Servius
has no remark. In ᾗ 31 the words of Macrobius partly correspond
with those of Servius Dan.) on Aen. 1 198, ‘totus hic locus de Naevii
Belli Punici libro (i 2³8 translatus est :’ and on Aen. 1 170, Servius
(Dan.) again mentions Naevius,
