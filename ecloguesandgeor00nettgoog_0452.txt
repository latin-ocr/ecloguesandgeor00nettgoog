Columella adopts a periphrasis: ‘ nec
minus vitentur cavae rupis aut vallis ar·
gutiae, quas Graeci ἠχοῦς vocant. ' There
is some impropriety in the use of ‘imago '
here, as though it suits ⁴ resultat,' it can-
notin strictness be called ⁴ offensa.' That
which strikes the rock (‘offenditur’) is
the actual sound 3 the reflection or echo is
that which is returned.

Modern writerS, [most recently Lub-
bock, Ants, BeeS, and Wasps, . 29o,]
doubt whether bees have a sense of earing.

the bees issue forth and spread them·

from flowers and streams what will sup·

Something perhaps is attributable to the
colour os the language, which is heightened
to identify the bees with larger animals,
especially with men.

‘ summa‚’ to the smallness of their draught.
