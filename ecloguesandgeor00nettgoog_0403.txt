‘ Abde domo ' has been taken by Heyne
and others to mean ‘ remove him from
home, ‘ send him offi' It more probably
means ‘take him up,’ ‘leave him no longer
out with the mares.' The Latin will bear
either, ‘domo’ being in the former case
ablative, in the latter probably dative, and
equivalent to ‘ in domum.' [For the dat.
compare A. 11 553 ‘lateri abdidit ensem,’
etc.] Nemesianus Cyneg. 141 has ‘ abda·
turque domo ’ sor ‘ be sent away from
home,’ but his authority is of less weight
than the analogy of Hor. 's ‘ abditus agro,'
Ep. 1 i 5, where, as Keightley remarks,
the mention of the horse immediately aster
looks like a reference to the present pas·
sage. [SerV. says ‘ domo ’ is for ‘ in
domo ' and is equivalent to ‘ domi. ’]

There is some doubt about the meaning
of ‘ nec turpi ignosce senectae.’ Serv„
who has been generally followed, proposes
to take ‘nec turpi' as ¹ et non turpi.’ It
seems better to take his other way, ‘ nec
ignosce turpi senectae‚' ⁸ suffer him not
to disgrace himself in his old age.'

⁸ Turpis' seems to be equivalent to

ἆσχὴμων. Ladewig comp. Sil. xv 651,
‘turpi finem donate senectae.'

98. ⁸ Ingratum‚’fruitless. Comp. 1 83,
‘nec nulla interea est inaratae gratia
terrae.' ‘ Proelia’ of course is to be ex·
plained from the context. ’

99. ‘ Sine viribus,' because the straw is
its only fuel. Med. originally and Gud.
omit ‘in ; ’ Rom. has ‘stipula.'

100. The emphatic word is ‘aevum'
Yon must first see that he is young and
vigorous.

101. ⁶ Hinc,' afterwards, that is, not
till you have looked to the age. ⁶ Artis,’
qualities. [Pal. bas ‘ partis. ’—-H. N.·]

⁸ Prolem parentum ,' the breed of his sire
and dam3 comp. Col. vn vi 7, ‘Parit
autem, si generosa est proles», duos)

102. ‘Cuique,’ in each case, whenever
you choose a horse to breed from. These
lines may be taken in a different way,
‘ prolem parentum’ being understood as
the other offspring of his sire and dam,
and ⁸ cuique ' as each member οἱῃτοὴίε off·
