P. VERGILI MARONIS

saxa per et scopulos et depressas convalles
diffugiunt, non, Eure, ωοε, neque Solis ad ortus,

nascitur et pluvio contristat frigore caelum.

hippomanes, quod saepe malae legere novercae,

rocurrit in occidentem iuxta Oceanum.’

e two latter add that foals so conceived
do not live beyond three years. Wind-
eggs were supposed to be produced in the
same manner, Varro 1. c. Comp. Aris-
toph. Birds 695, where the egg produced
by Night without a father is called
ὑπηνέμιον.

276. A spondaic termination generally

23, ‘Atque illud prono praece agitur
decursu.' The number os sylla les in a
spondaic line is smaller than in a dactylic
(a fact similar to that noticed by Johnson
in reference to imitative rhythm m English
poetry), and, where the notion os rapidity

as been already conveyed to the mind,
the balanced equality of two long syllables

smoothness. Judging merely hythe ear,
we might say that the change of metre
here expresses the motion downwards, as
in Homer and Catullus.

277. Aristotle says of the mares so im·
pregnated, θέουσι δὲ οὔτε πρὸς ἕω, οὔτε
πρὸς δυσμάς, ἀλλὰ πρὸς ἄρκτον ἢ νότον.
With this the words of Virg. cannot be
made to agree, whether we understand
him to mean that they run ‘ not to the east
nor to the north or south ’ (Martyn and
Keightley), or ‘ not to the east, but to the
north or south ' (Heyne and others). The
latter view might seem preferable, as dif-
sering from Aristotle by the omission only
os the west. But that difference is im-
portant, as it appears from v. 273 that

irg. did not mean to exclude the west, so
that on that point they are directly at
issue. We must suppose, then, either (1)

that Virg. wished to combine Aristotle’s
statement with that of others, who made
the west wind that from which the con-
{ipssssssssizeff'3113‘3‘3228¹2352.35st‘51' 3¹ss
wrote, as Martyn suggests, about some
place where the nearest sea lay to the
west, such as Lisbon (v. 276), and spoke
os the mares as only running westward,
while Aristotle, writing about Crete, as
naturall made them run north and south,
in whic direction the sea lies nearest.
The language does not enable us to decide
either way.

‘ Tuos ad ortus.’ as the east is called
‘ Euri domus ' 1 371.

278. ‘ Caurus ’ or ‘ Corus ' is N. W. ac·
cording to Pliny xvl11 338, with whom
Virg.’s description elsewhere (v, 356, A.
v 126) agrees. Gell. 11 22 makes it S.W.

‘sidere ' sor ‘ frigore)

280. ‘ Hic,' upon this, under these cir·

⁸ Vero nomine ' is explained to mean that
this is the true hippomanes, as distin-
guished from two other things that went
by the name, the supposed tubercle on
the sorehead os a young soal, mentioned
A. xv 515, and a plant used in incauta-
tionS, Theocr. 11 48. But it need mean
no more than that the hippomanes is
rightly called, ἐπώνυμος.

284·294. ‘But 1 dwell too long on
horses and cows3 Ι must sing of sheep
and goats, a difficult subject to trent
poetically‚ but the enthusiasm of an un·
touched theme carries me on.’
