xii PREFACE

though it is also conceivable that indications of this kind may
have arisen from changes in my own opinion, such as it is no less
natural to expect in the course of a protracted work.

Even a transient glauce at the contents of the present volume
will show that the production of it must necessarily have been a
work of time. It does not profeSS, indeed, any more than the
other editions of the Bibliotheca Classica, to be a work for the
learned, the result of elaborate original research. No manuscripts
have been consulted in the formation of the text: a very large
portion of the notes may be found in the commentaries of others.

In writing my notes 1 have had no one class of readers ex-
clusively in view, but have aimed at producing a commentary
which should contain such information as is suited to the various
wants of a somewhat mixed body—those who constitute the
highest classes in the larger schOOIS, and those who read for
classical honours at the Universities. As a general rule, how-
ever, 1 have said nothing where Ι did not think it possible that
a doubt might arise in the mind of a fairly instructed reader.
My custom has been to take every line as it came before me, and
ask myself whether Ι thoroughly understood it ; and this process
has often led me to entertain difficulties which had not previously
made themselves felt. Some of these 1 have come to think of
importance: others a little consideration has sufficed to dispel:
but it seemed worth while to endeavour to preclude the latter no
less than the former. I have not in general desired to furnish
information of a kind which is to be found in LexiconS, or in
well-known Dictionaries ofAntiquities,Biography and Mythology,
and Geography.

The essays which I have ventured to introduce in different
parts of the volume are intended in one way or another to
illustrate the literary peculiarities of Virgil’s poemS. Here, as
elsewhere, I have written rather for learners than for scholars: I
have sought to popularize what already exists in less accessible
formS. Two of these essayS, those introductory to the Eclogues
and the Georgics, were substantially delivered as public lectures
before the University: the remaining tWO, which are os much
slighter texture, were written for the present publication.

With regard to the text, I may refer generally to what I have
