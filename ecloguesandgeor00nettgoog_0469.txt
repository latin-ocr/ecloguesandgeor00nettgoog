210. The o der Romans, like the
Greeks, draw their notions of absolute
monarchy from the east. ‘Aegyptos ' is
selected no doubt because the war of
Actium was fought about the time that
V' . was finishing the Georgics. ‘Ingens
Ly ⁶ ' recalls the άλη ἀρχὴ os Croesus·
[‘ Ludia ' Rom.—l·²le.YN.]

211. The Parthians kissed the ground
when approaching their kings: Martial
x lxxii 5, ‘Ad Parthos procul ite pillea·
tos Et turpes humilesque supplicesque
Pictorum sola basiate regum.’

‘ Medus Hydaspes' is a geographical in·

‘ Medus ’ which gives the point, suggesting
the associations os Persian royal ‚ so that

A. 1 507, ‘ operumque laborem Partibus

occupations of the Carth ‘nians had

so that ' Virg. had n aware of the sex·

of the monach, he would perhaps have
made it a point in the com arison. The
first reading of Med. was ‘i le admiratur.’

217. Λέγεται δὲ καὶ φέρεσθαι αὐτὸν ὑπὸ

Aristot. H. A. rx 40. This takes place,
according to other writers, when the
monareh is sick, aged, or tired.

led some to think that bees are inspired
by the ‘divinity ’ which pervades an
creation.

219. Virg. consuses, rather characteris·
