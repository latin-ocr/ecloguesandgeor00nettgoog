Bucomc POETS OF ROME. 131

apparently speaks of himself as successor of the great Tityrus (doubtless
Virgil), consents to listen to an amoebean song from the brothers in
honour of the emperor. They invoke Caesar, speak of his superhuman
power in calming the ποοᾱε, rendering the cattle prolific, and fertilizing
the country, of the freedom to dig treasure and celebrate rural festivitieS,
and the general security enjoyed under his reign, and finally hope that
this Deity may live and rule for ever on earth. η Meliboeus compliments
them on the improvement in their singing which the change of subject
has produced, and Corydon in return hopes that he will prove a second
Maecenas to a second Virgil, introducing him to the imperial city, and
bidding him rise from rural to martial strains.

spsycon, the fifth Eclogue, is a kind of Georgic in a bucolic form.
The person who gives it its title, an old shepherd‚ takes the opportunity
of a mid-day sitting in the shade to lecture a young pupil on the care of
sheep and goatS, the times for grazing and milking, the cautions to be
observed in shearing, the remedies for wounded sheep, the best kind of
winter fodder, in a speech of 120 lines, rather closely studied after the
third Georgic of Virgil.

A pastoral quarrel, Littgium, is the subject of the sixth Eclogue,
Lycidas is informed by Astilus that he has just arrived too late for an
amoebean contest between Nyctilus and Alcon, in which the latter has
been conqueror. Lycidas has a different opinion of the prowess of the
combatantS, arraigns the judgment, and challenges the judge. A contest
is agreed on, Astilus wagering a stag, Lycidas a horse, and Mnasyllos,
the umpire, bids thern sing of their respective loveS. But a taunt from
Lycidas rouses his rival, and they appoer to be coming to blowS, when
they are stopped by MnasyIIOS, who declines to have anything to do
with this physica] encounter‚ and ends an Eclogue, not unreasonably
pronounced by Barth and Wernsdorf the most unsuccessful of Calpurnius’
bucolic efforts.

In the seventh and last Eclogue, to which a transcribet has given the
not very appropriate title of Templum, the chief speaker is a shepherd‚
newly returned from town, and full of a show which he has seen in the
amphitheatra where he has been particularly struck with the beauty of
the building and the variety of the wild beasts. ,He is congratulated on
being young when this glorious age is beginning, and questioned about
the personal appearance of the imperial deity. The answer which he
gives is complimentary enough as far as it goes but conveys little infor·
marion, and certainly forms rather an abrupt termination to an Eclogue
assumed to be the last of the series.
