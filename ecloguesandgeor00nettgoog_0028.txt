xxiv LI FE OF VIRGIL.

recited in the theatre. The same was the mse with some of the poems
of Ovid. On one occasion, if we may believe Tacitus‚¹ the whole
audience rose on hearing some of Virgil's verses, and testified their
homage to the poet, who happened to be present.

ξ 5. When Virgil began the Georgics there is no positive evidence to
determine. They were undertaken partly in honour of Maecenas,² as a
token of gratitude for the assistance which he had given the poet in the
troubles of the year 41. The line in the first Georgic (509), hic movet
Euphrates, illic Germania bellum, is usually taken as referring to the
events of 37 13.c. 3 but it is possible (see the note on the passage) that it
may have been written in 33 or 32. We know ⁸ that the Georgics were
read to Octavianus after his return from the East in 29 B.C. This then
is their terminus ad quem .· the only terminus a queis the passage alluding
to the portus Iulius in the second Georgic (161). This harbour was
completed by Agrippa in 37 B.C., and the verses in question cannot there-
fore be earlier than that event. And these limits tally sufficiently with the
statement of Suetonius ⁴ that the Georgioe were written in seven years.

Yet, if we are to press literally the concluding lines of the fourth
Georgic, Virgil must have written the bulk of the three first Georgics at
Naples in the years 31-29‚ when Octavianus was settling the affairs of
the East.⁶ The expressions of Virgil in this place need not, however,
mean more than that he was generally occupied with the work at that
time. He appears to have worked at the Georgics very slowly‚ writing
only a very few lines every day ς ⁶ and it may well be that although he
had begun the poem as early as 120. 36, the final touches were added
between 31 and 29. The Georgics themselves do not offer much in the
way of interna] evidence towards enabling us to decide when different
parts were composed. The openings of the first and third Georgic, 1 in-
cline to think, were written for the recitation of 29 ne„ later, that is,
than anything else in the whole work :' the conclusions of the first and of
the second Georgic are, perhapS, best referred to the end of 33 or the
beginning of 32 13.C. The conclusion of the fourth Georgic was re-
written after 26 (p. xxvi).

The opening of the third Georgic would be more easily intelligible
could we suppose that the book was written either in Greece, or after a
visit to that country. There is something to be urged in favour of this
hypothesis In the third ode of his first book, Horace speaks of a
Vergilius, whom he calls am'mae dirmdium meae, and for whom he prays
a safe journey to the coast of Attica. It is difficult, if not impossible, to
suppose that this Vergilius can be any one but our Virgil. The only re-
