GEORGICON

virgea praeterea Celei vilisque supellex,

arbuteae crates et mystica vannus Iacchi.
ornnia quae multo ante memor provisa reponeS,
si te digna manet divini gloria ruris

continuo in silvis magna vi flexa domatur

in burim et curvi formam accipit ulmus aratri.

huic ab stirpe pedes temo protentus in oct0,
binae aurea duplici aptantur dentalia dorso·

165. ‘Celeus,' Κελεός, father of Trip-
tolemus and Demophon, and the first
priest of Demeter at Eleusis.

‘ Virgea supellex ’ seems to include bas·
kets, oolanders, etc. (E. 11 71, x 71, G. 1
266, 11 241), as well as hurdles and fan.

166. Τ116 winnowing-fan was carried
in the Eleusinian processions in honour
of Iacchus, the son of Demeter and Zeus,
sometimes confounded with Bacchus (E.
{22:2⁵³ ,ξε anetus ”aed
Serv.. meant the saine. g

167. Hes. Works, 457, τῶν πρόσθεν
μελέτην ὶχὲμεν οἰκὴἲα θέσῑθαι. ‘ Memor’
seems a translation os μεμνημένος, Id. ib.
422. In the whole passage Virg. probably
had that rt of Hesiod’s poem before his
mind. ‘ epones,’ imperative: E. x 31.

[Pal. originally had ‘ provissa.'--H. N.]

168. ‘If you are destined (‘manet')
to win and wear the full honours of the

divine count .'

‘ Digna‚’ ‘2111ss i.e. glory such as would
be worth ambition. Serv. (‘ si te capit
dignitas ruris ’) explains it ‘ deemed worthy
by you ' (comp. 491): Keightley renders
‘ deserved,’ that is, due.

.....

‘ Divmi rs another attempt to revive
the sacred associations of rural life. The
same tone is perceptible in ‘ manet.’

169. ‘ Continuo ’ is explained by ⁴ in
silvis ς’ [comparer 356 note]. The words
camonly mean that the young elm while

thou ht of the possibility of the thing,
whic Keightley denies·

170. ‘Buris‚’ also ‘urvum,' γύης, 1116
plough-beam. Nothing in our plough
exactly answers to it. ‘It was a piece
of strong wood, naturally or artificially
cur-ved, to one end of which was affixed
the pole, to the other the ‘⁶ dentale,” and
into it was morticed the “stiva” It

therefore formed the body of the plough,

which from its shape is termed by Lu·

cretius “curvum '’ [as hereJ. . . In
Virg.’s plough the “ buris ” is of elm,
while in that of Hesiod it is of ilex
(πρῖνος).’ (Keightley.) Daubenyff. 101),
following segmen identifies the irgilian
and Hesiodic loughs with one still used
in the south o France under the name of
the Herault plough, where there is a
‘buris’ called ‘bassess S ier however
considers Hesiod’s ἔλυμα 10 1116 ⁸ buris,’
his γύης being the ‘ dentale!

171. ‘ ‘⁶ Temo,'' ρυμός [111 Hesiod ἱστο·
βοεῦς], 1116 pole. The “ temo '² was part
of the plough, as well as of a cart or
caat-inge: Thg yoke was fastenet}¹ to the
3¹1¹,ss ,¹‘.‘ ἓὲςῑοῗῖ &3320233‘ siy‘ssxeii
should be of elm or bay.’ Ke' htley, who
remarks that ‘protentus' ha better be
taken as a verb (instead of supplying
‘ aptatur ³), as the ‘temo ' is not fittedssoss

‘ Ab stirpe ’ is restored by Wagn. from
Med. corr. for ‘a stirpe ; ’ see E. vnt 41.

172. ‘ “Auris ” a would-heard. When
the plough was prepared for seed-sowing,
the “ aures '' or “tabellae ” (Varro 1 29)
were put to the ‘⁴ vomer,” so that it
then resembled our strike furrow plough.
Pliny (xvm 180) would seem to speak of
only one ‘⁴ auris,'' but perhaps his words
are not to be taken strictly! Keightley.

‘ “ Dentale,” ἔλυμα, 1116 share-beam, or
share-head, a iece of wood which was
fixed horizont ly at the lower end of the
“buri3‚’' and to which· the share was
fitted. In some cases the ‘⁴ dentale '’ was
itself shod with iron. lt is not certain
whether it was one solid piece of timber,
with a space to admit the end of the
“buriS,” or two pieoes fastened on each

like the ‘aures ' and ‘ dentalia.'
