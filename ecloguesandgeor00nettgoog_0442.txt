P. VERGILI MARONIS

solvuntur latera, atque oculos stupor urget inertis„
ad terramque fluit devexo pondere cervix.
quid labor aut benefacta iuvant? quid vomere terras

invertisse gravis? atqui non Massica Bacchi

munera, non illis epulae nocuere repostae:
frondibus et victu pascuntur simplicis herbae,
pocula sunt sontes liquidi atque exercita cursu

flumina, nec somnos abrumpit cura salubria

tempore non alio dicunt regionibus illis
quaesitas ad sacra boves IunoniS, et uris

spectators rather than os what would
attract eattle. Certainly the words ⁸ ui
. . . amnis’ show a genuine feeling or
the picturoeque as distinct from the mere
utilitarian appreciation of nature, such as
has been supposed to characterize the
classica] writers when compared with the

moderas.
⁸ Purior electro ε ’ prob. imitated from

Callim. Cer. 29, ὥστ’ &aarum ὕδωρ Ἐξ
ἀμαρᾶν ἀνέθυε. Virg. uses ⁸ electrum ’
both of amber (E. vui 54) and of the
metal (A. v111 402⁵ 624) ι either might be
meant here [but the latter (i-e. bright as
silver) is the more probable: comp. Iliad
¹¹ anamim feste}
v. 506, the extremity of the long flank,
implying that the whole length is relaxed
and unnerved.

523. ⁸ Dura quies oculos et ferreus urget
Somnus: A. x 745. [⁸ Urguet ’ Pal. and
Rom—H. N.]

524. ⁸ Fluit ² expresses gradual siuki .
⁸ Ad terram non sponte fluenS‚’ A. XI 825,
os Camilla falling from her horse in death ;
Curt. vm 14, ⁸ Rex fluentibus membris»,
omissisque armis, vix suicompos ;’ Martial
x1 xli 3, ⁸ Cedentis oneri ramos silvamque
fluentem Vicit.’

525. Scali er (Poet. v ιι) says of this
and the five {ollowing lines ⁸ malim a me
excogitata atque conlecta quam vel Croe-
sum vel Cyrum ipsum dicto habere audi·
entem.' Their spirit is that of a gentle
accusation of destiny, not unlike the tone
of A. 11 426 soll. ⁸ Benefactm’ his services
to men.

526. ‘Gravis’ expresses the difficulty
he has surmounted. He has performed
his part in the grand system of labour
which the gods have ordained (1 63, 121
solt), yet he reaps no fruit.

⁴ Massica,’ 11 143.

527. ⁸ Repostae z ' [⁸ aut abundantae aut
variae,' Serv. and Berne schol.—-H. N.]
Virg. uses ⁸reponere’ of seasts in three
other passages. (1) In A. v111 175 an in·
terrupted feast is resumed. (2) In A. vn
134 wine is brought on aster the net
(comp. ΙΙ. 1 470 ; A. 1 724). (3) In G. ιν
378 we have perhaps a condensed descrip-
tion in which banquet and subsequent wine
333551’5522‘25, ¹133? Pisshsitaffpffiff
11 88, ‘instaurare iem festasque reponere
mensas,' a feast is resumed aster inter-
ruption. Here probably ⁸ repostae' refers
to the second course, that is, it denota
abundance and luxury. Voss interpr-ets it
of cherished stores, but Heyne objects that
they would go had, and Quint. 11 4 says
⁸ fgstidiurn moveant velut frigidi et repositi
ci t.'

528. ⁸ Simplicis ’ opposed to the arts of
cookery displayed in an elaborate banquet.

529. ‘Pocula‚'the cu at human feasts,
with which their draug ts are contrasted.
See E. vm 28.

⁸ Exercita cursu ’ (comp. ⁸ exercita mo·
tu,’ Lucr. 11 97, and the use of γυμνά-
ζεσθαι, Aesch. Prom. 586, 592) seems to
mean ⁸ rapid.’ It is difficult to discover
its exact relevancy to the case os the cattle.
A contrast may be intended, as Wagn.
thinks, between flowing and stagnant
water: but that is indicated by the noun
as much as by the epithet.

531. ⁸ Tempore non alio: ’ this was the
first time. ⁸ Illaque haudque alia . . .
luce‚’ Catull. 1„le 16.

532. ⁸ Quaesitas‚’ sought and not found,
like Horace’s ⁸ Sublatam ex oculis quae·
rimus invidi ' (Od. 111 xxiv 32). On other
gcgsipgs they offered themselves without
