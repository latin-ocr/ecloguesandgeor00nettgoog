further, thou wilt gain nought, and lose many words! A house,
a female slave, an ox, and household stuff are what a man
should provide for himself, and that without delay, for delay fills
no granaries. The rainy season of autmunn is the time when
wood is cut best: it is then that the various parts of the plough
should be shaped, each from its proper tree. Two oxen nine
years old should be chosen for yoking together, and the plough-
man should not be under forty years: a younger man is always
flying off to his companions. The cry of the crane is the signal
for ploughing: before that every thing should be in readiness,
‘ It is easy to say, Lend me your oxen and your plough : and'it
is as easy to reply, My oxen have their own work to do! Slave
and master alike should put to their hand, the master guiding the
plough, not without prayers to Zeus and Demeter, while* the
slave a little behind gives trouble to the birds by covering the

maiden that sits at home with her mother, or lies warm in bed,
well bathed and anointed. Then is the time to go warm clad
and thick shod, finish work early, and get home before the storm.
At the rising of Arcturus the vines are to be pruned before the
swallow appears ; but when House-carrier ¹ (the snail) leaves the
earth and mounts the trees, then the sickle should be sharpened
and the slaves called early. ‘ Morning cuts off a third of the
day's work: morning makes way in travelling, and makes way
in working—morning, whose dawn sets many a man on his road,
and puts the yoke on many an ox.’ But when the thistle is in
blossom‚ and the cicala pours its midsummer song from the trees,
weary man must look for enjoyment, for a rock to shelter him,
milk and wine to drink‚ and bees and kid's flesh to eat. As soon
as Orion riseS, the corn should be winnowed: that done, the
