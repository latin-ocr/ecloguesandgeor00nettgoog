18 BUCOLICA.

Eclogues would be endleSS, as it would perhaps be superfluous in
an essay intended to be introductory to the perusal of the poems
in detail. Where I have been sensible of thern, 1 have generally
endeavoured to indicate them in the commentary, though 1 fear
that through brevity and other faults of expression Ι have not
always succeeded in conveying the impression 1 desired. The
chief instance, in my judgment, of sustained and systematic art
is that presented by the fourth Eclogue, to the notes on which I
would accordingly beg to refer the reader. In this place, how·
ever, it may be worth while to illustrate my meaning by a brief
review of those passages in the Eclogues in which external nature
is represented as in sympathy with the joys and sorrows of
ἴ pastoral life. The frequent repetition of the notion may speak ill
for Virgil’s capacity of invention: the variety with which it is
- presented, extending not merely to form, but to colour, is a signal
1 witness to the rnodifying power of his fancy. Let us look at the
two passage5‚ in some sort parallel, where pines and springs call
for the absent TityruS, and where mountain and vineyard shout
in the ears of Menalcas the apotheosis of Daphnis The former,
properly understood, seerns to be a piece of graceful raillery,
rerninding the gardener that while he was away his trees were
undressed, and the boarS, perhapS, wallowing in his springs. The
latter has a grandeur about it recalling the sublimity of Jewish
prophecy, at the same tirne that we are apparently intended to
think not only of nature endowed with human feeling, but of
actual human joy, the joy of the traveller on the mountain and
of the vine-dresser under the rock. Even the epithet intonsi
montes would seem to have a double reference: in one of its
aspects it suggests the notion of a pathless wild, and thus brings
out the universality of the rejoicing: in another it makes us feel
with nature as it were against rnan, representing the mountains
as glorying in that strength which nature gave and the reign of
Daphnis will secure to thern, as the fir-trees and cedars in Isaiah
exult over the king of Babylon, ‘ Since thou art laid down, no
feller is come up against us! So the same changes in the order
of nature are named at one time among the glories of the coming
golden age, at another as effects of a general curse, which is to
transfer the rights of the strong and beautiful to the weak and
