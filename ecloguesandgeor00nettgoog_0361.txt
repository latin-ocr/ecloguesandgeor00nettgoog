The words of Col. quoted on v, 267 might
be pleaded for the ordinary vieW, but he
follows Virg. so closely that his use of
language cannot be considered indepen-
dent.

‘ Qua parte calores austrinos tulerit‚’
‘the part on which it bore the brunt of
the southern heat.' [Med. originally had
‘ steterint’ and ‘ tulerint. '—H. Ν.]

271. ‘ Axi,' the north pole. Comp. ιη
351, ‘ Quaque redi’t medium thdope
ffieffissssssb ἔὲωιὲπιςῖἒῖ ἴῖηὲἰΐὲο ¹¹1¹ssss
cold wind oi the north.

272. ‘ Adeo in teneris consuescere mul-
tum est,' ‘so powersul are habits formed
in tender age.’ The connexion r uires
this rather than ‘ so powerful is ha it in
the case of things os tendet age! The
poet is speaking of habits formed in the
nursery, and in their effects extending to
the ‘arbustum’ ‘In teneris’ then has
the sorce os ‘in teneris anniS,’ though we
need not suppose an ellipse.

The line is quoted by Quint. 1 3 with
‘ a teneris‚’ habits which have lasted from
insan .

273287. ‘Plant your vines closely on
the plain 3 on slopes more widely, yet still
in regular lines and at equal distanceS, so
as to present the ap rance os a legion,
and that not merely or appearance, but to
gtive eailssglant, as much growing roorn as
1 s ne urs.

2731.ε Some vines were better suited for
theghffl’ some for the plain. See Col. 111
ι, .

272. ‘ Prius: ’ another preliminary,
which ought in strictness to have pre-
ceded that mentioned in the last para-
graffiterfam ginno ante memientO, etc(i

ι 1s esameas‘ ano’an
the emp tic word. ‘ If you mensure out,
or set apart for a vineyard, fields in a rich
plain.' ‘Pinguis,' opp. to the light soil
os the hills. with the language comp.
the oraele in Hdt. 1 66, καὶ καλὸν πεδίον

σχοίνῳ διαμετρήσασθαι.

There seems to have been another read·
ing, ‘agri—campos,’ supported by Gud.
and partly by Pal.

275. It would be harsh to take ‘ densa ⁹
as strictly adverbial. It is rather an ad·
jective agreeing with an indefinite sub·
stantive.

‘ Non segnior ubere,’ not less prolific.
Comp. ‘segnes terrae,' v. 37, ‘segnis
carduus,' 1 151, and sor ‘segnis' with
abl. A. vn 383 (note). ‘In denso' ==
‘in loco denso consito:’

comp. ‘ in
sicc0. '

‘In denso ubere' could scarcely
mean anything buta close or stiff soil, and
such is really the sense of ‘ densus ’ in Ov.
M. 11 576, ‘densumque relin uo Litus, et
in molli nequiquam lassor arena,’ ex·
pressing the crowding of the parts os the
soil. not, as Wund., followed by Forb.,
explains it, the crowding of things upon
it. ‘ Uber ' is specially used of the fruit-
fulness of the vine 3 Col. ιν 27, ⁶ ut ubere
suo gravatam vitem levet ς’ Claud. B. G.
504, ‘ palmitis uber Etrusci.' ‘ Not less
prolific than when lanted wide, because
in the rich plain t ere is abundance of
nutriment!

276. ‘ Supinos,' ently slo ing, so as to
present a broad su ace, which seems to be
the general notion of the word as applied
not only to hills but to plains and the sea.
See Bentl. on Hor. Epod. 1 29.

277, 278. ‘ Indulge,’ give your rows
room, set them wide.

‘ Nec setius τ ’ the order of words is pro-
bably ‘nec setius (quam si densa seras)
omnis secto limite via, arboribus positis,
quadret in unguem‚’ i.e. still (as much as
when planting close) let each avenne with
drawn line, as you plant your trees, tally
exactly,=plant so that the line os each
avenne exactly tallies with the rest. No·
thing more than regularity is prescribed in
the two lines so understood ε it is the
simile os the legion in vv. 279, 280 which
shows [or, at least, is usually held to
shoggdthat the ‘ quincuncialis ordo ' is in·
ten .
