P. VERG1L1 MARONIS

dum fovet, ac, ne me sibi praeferat illa, veretur,
hic alienus ovis custos bis mulget in hora, 5
et sucus pecori et lac subducitur agnis,

D.

Parcius ista viris tamen obicienda memento,

novimuS, et qui te, transversa tuentibus hircis,
et quo—sed faciles Nymphae risere—sacello,
M. Tum, credo, cum me arbustum videre Miconis 10
atque mala vitis incidere falce novellas
D. Aut hic ad veteres fagos cum Daphnidis arcum ·
fregisti et calamos: quae tu, perverse Menalca,
et cum vidisti puero donata dolebaS,
et si non aliqua nocuisses mortuus esses, 15
M. Quid domini faciant, audent curn talia fures?

4. ‘ Fovet‚’ courts, repeatedly used by
. Cicero in the sense of paying attention to
a person: comp. the sense of constant
attendance‚ eg. ‘ castra fovere,’ A. tx
⁵⁷3. ‘Twice an hour,’ when twice a day
would have been sun measure, as Serv.
remarks. The phrase is exaggerated z but
the offence of secret milking was a common
one, punished, Emmen. says, with whip-
3³35. ³1¹3ssaess walggls· ιωῖῗῖῃῗιέῑῗῖ ³⁵

6. ‘The ewes are exhausted and ’the
lambs starved.’ Perhaps, as Voss thinks,
he may mean the time before the lambs

were weaned, when the ewes ought not to
have been milked. ‘depc-ere’ need
only mean to withdraw, as in C'ic. Tusc.
11 1 7,”³subduc cibum unum diem athletae 3 '
here however the additional notion of
stealth is suggested by the context. [Pal.
had ‘ lact: see 11 22.—H. N.]

8. [‘ Hircis' Rom. Gud.‚ ‘hircuis’
Pal. originally, and so Ribbeck. Serv.
quotes Suetonius De vitiis CorporalibuS‚
‘hirqui sunt oculorum anguli.’—H. N.]

10. ‘Tum (‘risere’).' ⁸ Credo,' ironi-
cal. A. vn 297. Menalcas affeets to

vines were trained on trees, op ed to
espaliers: here the trees on w ich the
vines were trained.

‘ Miconis vitis ’ Tbeocr. v 112.

11. ‘Mala salce‚' like ‘dolo ma10,’
‘mala fraude,’ malicious. Tibull. 111 v
20, ‘Et modo nata mala vellere poma

manu.' Pliny, xvn 1, says that the

Twelve Tables imposed a heavy fine
for cutting another man’s trees ‘ iniuria.'

‘ Novellas ' emphatic, as the young
vines ought not to have been touched with
the knife, G. 11 365. The word isa tech-
nical term in rural economy, being used in
later Latin substantively for a young vine;
‘novello’ means to plant young trees (Suet.
Dom. 7) and ‘ novelletum,' a nursery.

12. ‘ Ad veteres fagos ε ’ the same scenery
as in 11 3, xx 9. The bow and arrows be·
longed to a shepherd ε see 11 29 note.

13. ‘ Perverse ’ equivalent to ‘ prave.’
The passage is imitated from Theocr. v 12,
τὺ δ’, ὧ κακέ, καὶ rcix’ ἐτάκευ Βασκιιὶνωι·,
καὶ νῦν με τὰ λοίσθια γυμνὸν ἔθηκας, which
accounts for the repetition of ‘ et.’

14. The ‘ puer is evidently DaphniS,
not, as Heyne thinks, some boy to whom
he gave the bow and arrows.

15. Comp. vn 26.

16. ‘ Fures ’ is comic for
Comp. Hor. Ep. 1 vi 45, ‘Exilis domus
est ubi non et multa supersunt Et dominum
fallunt et prosunt furibus! Com also
the double meaning of the English ‘ nave ²
and ‘ villain,' though there the process of
change in meaning has been reversed.
‘ What will the master do if the man talks
at this rate?' It seems a proverbial ex·
pression ε at any rate the sense is clear, in
spite of the ob‘ections os VVagn. and Forb.,
as the whole orm of the line shows that
‘ domini ' and ‘ sures ’ are meant to be
correlative. ‘ FureS,’ in fact, involves·
⁸ servi,' and something more, preparing us
for Menalcas’ new charge.

‘ Faciant,' i.e. if they were to come on

‘ servi.'
